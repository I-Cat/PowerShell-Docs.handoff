Additionally, you can specify Open Mobile Alliance Uniform Resource Identifier (OMA-URI) values to create custom settings that are not available from Intune.\n\n## General configuration settings\n\nUse the Microsoft Intune **Windows Phone general configuration policy (Windows Phone 8.1 and later)** to configure the following settings for Windows Phone 8.1 devices:\n\n-   **Mobile device security settings** – Choose from a list of predefined settings that let you control a range of features and functionality on the device.\n\n-   **Compliant and noncompliant apps** - Specify a list of apps that are compliant or not compliant in your company. Windows Phone devices can block or allow installation of these apps.\n\n### Applicability settings\n\n|Setting name|Details|\n|----------------|----------------------------------|\n|**Apply all configurations to Windows 10**|Enables settings in this policy to be applied to Windows 10 Mobile devices in addition to Windows Phone 8.1 devices.|\n\n### Password settings\n\n|Setting name|Details|Windows Phone 8|Windows Phone 8.1|\n|----------------|------|-----|------------------------------|\n|**Require a password to unlock mobile devices**|Specifies whether users must enter a password to access their devices.|Yes|Yes|\n|**Required password type**|Specifies the type of password that will be required, such as alphanumeric or numeric only.|Yes|Yes|\n|**Required password type – Minimum number of character sets**|Specifies how many different character sets must be included in the password.

You cannot specify both in the same policy.\n\n|Setting name|Details|\n|----------------|--------------------|\n|**Block devices from opening the listed apps**|Lists the apps that are not managed by Intune, and which users are not allowed to install and run.|\n|**Allow devices to install only the listed apps**|Lists the apps that users are allowed to install.

You can now use this as the URL in either the allowed or blocked apps list.\n\n**Example:** Search the store for the Skype app. The URL you use will be **http://www.windowsphone.com/store/app/skype/c3f8e570-68b3-4d6a-bdbb-c0a3f4360a51**.\n\n## Custom policy settings\nUse the Microsoft Intune **Windows Phone custom configuration policy** to deploy OMA-URI settings that can be used to control features on **Windows Phone 8.1 devices**. These are standard settings that many mobile device manufacturers use to control device features.\n\nThis capability enables you to deploy Windows Phone settings that are not configurable with an Intune general configuration policy. For information about the settings you can configure with these policies, see [Manage settings and features on your devices with Microsoft Intune policies](manage-settings-and-features-on-your-devices-with-microsoft-intune-policies.md).\n\nFor help creating OMA-URI settings for Windows Phone devices, see [Windows Phone 8.1 MDM protocol documentation](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn499787.aspx).\n\n### General settings\n\n|Setting name|Details|\n|----------------|--------------------|\n|**Name**|Enter a unique name for the policy to help you identify it in the Intune console.|\n|**Description**|Provide a description that gives an overview of the policy and other relevant information that helps you to locate it.|\n\n### OMA-URI settings\n\nIn the **OMA-URI Settings** section, click **Add** to add a setting.
