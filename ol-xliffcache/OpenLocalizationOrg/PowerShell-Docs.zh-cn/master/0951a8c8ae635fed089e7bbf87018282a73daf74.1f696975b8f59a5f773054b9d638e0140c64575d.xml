If you want to add apps for Windows PCs that you manage by using the Intune client software, see [Add apps for Windows PCs in Microsoft Intune](add-apps-for-windows-pcs-in-microsoft-intune.md).\n\n## Add the app\nYou use the Intune Software Publisher to configure the properties of the app and, where applicable, upload it to your cloud storage space. Use the following procedure:\n\n1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administrator console](https://manage.microsoft.com), choose **Apps** &gt; **Add Apps** to start the Intune Software Publisher.\n\n    > [!TIP]\n    > You might need to enter your Intune user name and password before the publisher starts.\n\n2.
