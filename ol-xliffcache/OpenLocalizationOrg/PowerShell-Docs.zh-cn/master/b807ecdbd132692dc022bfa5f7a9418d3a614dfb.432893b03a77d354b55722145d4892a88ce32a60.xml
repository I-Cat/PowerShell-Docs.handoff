Wi-Fi, or email profiles, you can secure the access by using a certificate that is installed on each user device. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Make sure you have the right certificate infrastructure in place, as described in [Configure certificate infrastructure for SCEP](configure-certificate-infrastructure-for-scep.md) and [Configure certificate infrastructure for PFX](configure-certificate-infrastructure-for-pfx.md).\n\n2. Install a root certificate or an intermediate Certification Authority (CA) certificate on each device so that the device recognizes the legitimacy of your CA. To do this, create and deploy a **Trusted Certificate Profile**. When you deploy this profile, the devices that you manage with Intune will request and receive the root certificate. You have to create a separate profile for each platform. The **Trusted Certificate Profile** is available for these platforms:\n -  iOS 8.0 and later\n -  Mac OS X 10.9 and later\n -  Android 4.0 and later\n -  Windows 8.1 and later\n -  Windows Phone 8.1 and later\n\n3. Create certificate profiles so that devices request a certificate to be used for authentication of VPN, Wi-Fi, and email access, as described in [Configure Intune certificate profiles](configure-intune-certificate-profiles.md). You can create and deploy a **PKCS #12 (.PFX) Certificate Profile** *or* a **SCEP Certificate Profile** for devices running these platforms:\n\n  -  iOS 8.0 and later\n  -  Android 4.0 and later\n  -  Windows 10 (desktop and mobile) and later\n\n  Use a **SCEP Certificate Profile** for devices running these platforms:\n    -   Mac OS X 10.9 and later\n    -   Windows Phone 8.1 and later\n\nYou must create a separate profile for each platform. When you create the profile, associate it with the **Trusted Root Certificate Profile** that you've already created.\n\n> [!NOTE]           \n> - If you don't have an Enterprise Certification Authority, you must create one.\n>- If you decide, based on your device platforms, to use the Simplified Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) profile, you'll also need to configure a Network Device Enrollment Service (NDES) server.\n>-  Whether you plan to use SCEP or .PFX profiles, you must download and configure the Microsoft Intune Certificate Connector.\n>-  Learn how to configure all of the required services in [Configure certificate infrastructure for SCEP](configure-certificate-infrastructure-for-scep.md) or [Configure certificate infrastructure for PFX](configure-certificate-infrastructure-for-pfx.md).\n\n### Next steps\n- [Configure certificate infrastructure for SCEP](configure-certificate-infrastructure-for-scep.md)\n- [Configure certificate infrastructure for PFX](configure-certificate-infrastructure-for-pfx.md)\n- [Configure Intune certificate profiles](configure-intune-certificate-profiles.md)\n"}
