of ways depending upon the device, how it was purchased, and the needs of the organization. Corporate-owned devices can also be enrolled and managed by installing the Company Portal app as in \"bring your own device\" (BYOD) scenarios.\n\n## Corporate-owned iOS devices\nThese enrollment methods are good for \"Choose your own device\" (CYOD) scenarios where the organization purchases the devices for users, but wants to retain management of the device. If your organization has purchased iOS devices, you can pre-configure enrollment so that the device is managed from the first time its user turns it on. Intune supports enrollment via [Apple's Device Enrollment Program (DEP)](ios-device-enrollment-program-in-microsoft-intune.md) or using the Apple Configurator tool running on a Mac computer for [direct](ios-direct-enrollment-in-microsoft-intune.md) or [Setup Assistant](ios-setup-assistant-enrollment-in-microsoft-intune.md) enrollment.\n\n[Enroll corporate-owned iOS devices](enroll-corporate-owned-ios-devices-in-microsoft-intune.md)\n\n## Device enrollment manager\nOrganizations can use Intune to manage large numbers of mobile devices with a single user account called a device enrollment manager account. After creating a device enrollment manager account, that account can be used by a manager to enroll more than the standard five devices allowed by default to normal users. Enrolling devices with a device enrollment manager only works for devices that aren't used by a specific user. These devices are good for point-of-sale or utility apps, for example, but bad for users who need access to email or company resources.\n\n[Enroll corporate-owned devices with the device enrollment manager](enroll-corporate-owned-devices-with-the-device-enrollment-manager-in-microsoft-intune.md)\n\n## Enroll corporate-owned Windows 10 desktops\n\nIf your organization has Azure Active Directory Premium (AADP) or Enterprise Management Suite (EMS), you can [enroll Windows 10 for enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/active-directory/active-directory-azureadjoin-windows10-devices-overview) and they will be automatically tagged as \"corporate-owned\" when users add their work or school account.\n\n## Identify devices as corporate-owned\n\nCorporate-owned devices are listed as **Corporate**  under **Ownership** in lists of devices. Devices can be identified as corporate-owned in the following ways:\n\n - [Enrolled with device enrollment manager (DEM)](enroll-corporate-owned-devices-with-the-device-enrollment-manager-in-microsoft-intune.md)\n - Enrolled with Apple's [device enrollment program (DEP)](ios-device-enrollment-program-in-microsoft-intune.md)  or [Apple Configurator](ios-setup-assistant-enrollment-in-microsoft-intune.md)\n - [Predeclare devices with IMEI numbers](specify-corporate-owned-devices-with-international-mobile-equipment-identity-imei-numbers.md)\n - [Azure Active Directory/Enterprise Management Suite registration of Windows 10 devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/active-directory/active-directory-azureadjoin-windows10-devices-overview)\n\n### International mobile equipment identity (IMEI)\n\nUnique international mobile equipment identity (IMEI) numbers are a common device property for many mobile device manufacturers. Intune administrators can import IMEI numbers for devices the company owns. When the device becomes managed by Intune, it is tagged as a corporate-owned device.\n\n[Specify corporate-owned devices with international mobile equipment identity (IMEI) numbers](specify-corporate-owned-devices-with-international-mobile-equipment-identity-imei-numbers.md)\n"}
