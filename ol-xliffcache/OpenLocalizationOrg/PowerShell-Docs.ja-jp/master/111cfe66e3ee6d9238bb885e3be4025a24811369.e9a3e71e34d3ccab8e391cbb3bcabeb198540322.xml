lost or stolen, or if the employee leaves your company, you want to make sure company app data is removed from the device. However, you may not want to remove personal data on the device, especially if this is an employee owned device.\n\nTo selectively remove company app data, create a wipe request using the steps described  in this **Create a wipe request** section in this topic.  Once the request is completed, the next time the app runs on the device, company data is removed from the app.\n>[!NOTE]\n> Contacts synced directly from the app to the native address book are removed. Any contacts synced from the native address book to another external source cannot be wiped. Currently this is applicable only to the Microsoft Outlook app.\n\n\n\n## Create a wipe request\n\n1.  In the **Intune Mobile application management** blade, choose the **Wipe requests** tile.\n\n    ![Screenshot of Intune mobile application management blade with Summary tile](../media/AppManagement/AzurePortal_MAM_WipeRequests.png)\n\n2.  Choose  **New wipe requests**.\n\n    ![Screenshot of the New wipe request blade](../media/AppManagement/AzurePortal_MAM_NewWipeRequest.png)\n\n3.  In the **New wipe request** blade, choose **User** to open the **User** blade and select the user whose app data you want to wipe.\n\n4.  Choose **Device**.  This opens the **Device** blade that lists all the devices associated with the selected user.  Select the device you want to wipe.\n\n5.  You are now back in the **New wipe request** blade. Choose **Ok** to make a wipe request. The service creates and tracks a separate wipe request for each protected app on the device.\n\n\n![Screenshot of the Wipe requests tile ](../media/AppManagement/AzurePortal_MAM_WipeRequestsSummary.png)\n\n## Monitor your wipe requests\nThe **Intune mobile application management** blade has a summarized report on the **Wipe request** tile.  It displays the overall status and includes the number of pending requests, and failures. You can get more details by following the steps described below:\n\n1.  In the **Intune mobile application management** blade, choose the **Wipe request** tile to open the **Wipe request** blade.\n\n2.  In the **Wipe request** blade, you can see the list of your requests grouped by users.  Since the system creates a wipe request for each protected app running on the device, you might see multiple requests for a user.  The status indicates whether a wipe request is still **pending**, **failed**, or **successful**.\n\n### See also\n[Protect app data using mobile app management policies ](protect-app-data-using-mobile-app-management-policies-with-microsoft-intune.md)\n\n[Using the Azure portal](azure-portal-for-microsoft-intune-mam-policies.md)\n"}
