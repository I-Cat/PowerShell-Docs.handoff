You are now prompted to set a **PIN** for the app. (if you configured the policy for this).\n\n    ![Screenshot of OneDrive app asking for a PIN](../media/AppManagement/iOS_AppPINPrompt.png)\n\n5.  Once you set the PIN and confirm,  you are able to access the files on your **OneDrive for Business**.\n\n    ![Screenshot showing the file location open with the list of existing files](../media/AppManagement/iOS_OneDriveSuccess.png)\n\n    > [!NOTE]\n    > When you change a deployed policy, the changes will be applied next time you open the app.\n\n##  Accessing OneDrive on an Android device\n\n1.

Once your credentials are successfully authenticated by **Azure AD**, you should see a message displayed with instructions to install the company portal app, if it is not already installed on the device.  Tap on **Get the app** to proceed.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>The Company Portal app is required for all apps associated with MAM policies on Android devices.

Once you have completed the install, choose **Accept** to accept the terms.\n\n6.  The **OneDrive** app launches automatically.\n\n7.  The next time you open OneDrive, you will see the prompt to set a **PIN**, provided the policy settings are set to require a PIN to access the **OneDrive** app.\n\n    ![Screenshot of the OneDrive app with the PIN prompt](../media/AppManagement/Android_OneDriveSetPIN.png)\n\n8.  Once the PIN is set and confirmed, you can continue using **OneDrive**, which is now managed by app policies.\n\n\n##  Using apps with multi-identity support\nMicrosoft Word is used as an example for this scenario.\n\n1.  Open the **Word** app on your device. We are using an iOS device to show the steps.\n\n2.

If a device has more than one work account, only one work account is managed by the MAM policies.\n\nDepending on the app that you are using, the second user may or may not be blocked on the device. However, in all cases, only the first user who gets the MAM policies is affected by the policy.\n\nIf a device has existing multiple user accounts before the MAM policies are deployed, the account that the MAM policies is deployed to first is managed by Intune MAM policies.\n\n**Microsoft Word**, **Excel**, and **PowerPoint** don't block a second user account, but the second user account is not affected by the MAM policies.  \n\nFor **OneDrive and Outlook apps**, you can only use one work account.  Adding multiple work accounts are blocked on these apps.  You can however, remove a user and add a different user on the device.\n\nRead the example scenario below to get a deeper understanding of how multiple user accounts are treated.\n\nUser A works for two companies - **Company X**, and **Company Y**. User A has a work account for each company, and both use Intune to deploy MAM policies. **Company X** deploys MAM policies **before** **Company Y**. The account associated with **Company X** will get the MAM policy, but not the account associated with Company Y. If you want the user account associated with Company Y to be managed by the MAM policies, you must remove the user account associated with Company X.\n### Adding a second account\n#### IOS\nIf you are using an iOS device, when you try to add a second work account on the same device, you may see blocking message.  You will also see an option to remove the existing account and add a new one. You can do so by choosing **Yes**.\n\n![Screenshot of the dialog box with the blocking message and Yes and No options](../media/AppManagement/iOS_SwitchUser.PNG)\n####  Android\nIf you are using an Android device, You may see a blocking message with instructions to remove the existing account and add a new one.  On Android devices, to remove the existing account, go to **Settings &gt;General &gt; Application Manager &gt;Company Portal and select \"Clear Data\"**.\n\n![Screenshot of the error message and instructions to remove the account](../media/AppManagement/Android_SwitchUser.png)\n\n##  Viewing media files with the Rights Management sharing app\nTo view company AV, PDF, and image files on Android devices, use the [Microsoft Rights Management (RMS) sharing app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.ipviewer).\n\nDownload this app from the  Google Play store.  Once the app is installed on your device, launch the app and authenticate with your company credentials. You should now be able to view unprotected and protected files from other policy-managed apps.\n\nThe following filetypes are supported:\n\n* **Audio:** AAC LC, HE-AACv1 (AAC+), HE-AACv2 (enhanced AAC+), AAC ELD (enhanced low delay AAC), AMR-NB, AMR-WB, FLAC, MP3, MIDI, Vorbis, PCM/WAVE.\n* **Video:** H.263, H.264 AVC, MPEG-4 SP, VP8.\n* **Image:** jpg, pjpg, png, ppng, bmp, pbmp, gif, pgif, jpeg, pjpeg.\n* PDF, PPDF\n\n------------\n|**pfile**|**text**|\n|----|----|\n|Pfile is a generic “wrapper” format for protected files that encapsulates the encrypted content and the RMS licenses and can be used to protect any file type.|Text files, including XML, CSV, etc. can be opened for viewing in the app even when they are protected. File types: txt, ptxt, csv, pcsv, log, plog, xml, pxml.|\n---------------\n**Android devices that are not enrolled in Intune**\n\nBefore you can use the RMS sharing app to view files from other apps managed by Intune, launch the RMS app and authenticate with your work account.  When you log in, you will see the following message **only if you don’t have an RMS license**:\n\n**Authentication Successful – You can now view corporate files, but your organization isn’t set up to let you protect files. Contact your IT admin for more details.**\n\nThis does not prevent you from using the RMS sharing app to view company files. You can still open and view company files from other apps managed by Intune, and the MAM policies will still apply.  What this message is saying is that you will not be able to add the additional protection capabilities that the RMS sharing app provides.  You must have an RMS license to add protection to your files. To learn more about RMS file protection capabilities, see [Protect a file on a device](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rights-management/rms-client/sharing-app-protect-in-place)  and [Protect a file that you share by email](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rights-management/rms-client/sharing-app-protect-by-email).\n\n\n### See also\n[Create and deploy mobile app management policies with Microsoft Intune](create-and-deploy-mobile-app-management-policies-with-microsoft-intune.md)\n"}
