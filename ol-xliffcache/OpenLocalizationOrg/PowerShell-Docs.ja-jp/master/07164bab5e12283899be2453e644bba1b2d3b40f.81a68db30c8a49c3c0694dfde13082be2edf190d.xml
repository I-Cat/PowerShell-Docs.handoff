the item to the gallery.\nSometimes this metadata needs to be managed beyond the initial item publishing, which means the owner metadata needs to be mutable while the item itself is not.\n\nAll item owners are peers. \nThis means any item owner can publish a new version of an item. It also means that any item owner can remove any other item owner. \nNo owner has more authority than other owners.  \n\n## Setting an Item's Initial Owner \n\nWhen a new item is published to PowerShell Gallery, the initial owner is defined by the user that published the item.
