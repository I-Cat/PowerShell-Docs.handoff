Note the use of the wildcard character, which is particularly helpful if you're not sure of the full name of the app. For example, to get the info for OneNote, use `Get-AppxPackage *OneNote`.\n\n\nHere is the information retrieved for OneNote:\n\n`Name                   : Microsoft.Office.OneNote`\n\n`Publisher              : CN=Microsoft Corporation, O=Microsoft Corporation, L=Redmond, S=Washington, C=US`\n\n`Architecture           : X64`\n\n`ResourceId             :`\n\n`Version                : 17.6769.57631.0`\n\n`PackageFullName        : Microsoft.Office.OneNote_17.6769.57631.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe`\n\n`InstallLocation        : C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps`\n\n`\\Microsoft.Office.OneNote_17.6769.57631.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe`\n\n`IsFramework            : False`\n\n**`PackageFamilyName      : Microsoft.Office.OneNote_8wekyb3d8bbwe`**\n\n`PublisherId            : 8wekyb3d8bbwe`\n\n\n\n## Find a PFN if the app is not installed on a computer\n\n1.  Go to https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps.\n2.  Enter the name of the app in the search bar. In our example, search for OneNote.\n3.  Choose the link to the app. Note that the URL has a series of letters at the end. In our example, the URL looks like this:\n`https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/onenote/9wzdncrfhvjl`.\n4.  In a different tab, paste the following URL, `https://bspmts.mp.microsoft.com/v1/public/catalog/Retail/Products/<app id>/applockerdata`. Replace `<app id>` with the app id that you got from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps - that series of letters at the end of the URL in step 3. In our example of OneNote, you'd paste: `https://bspmts.mp.microsoft.com/v1/public/catalog/Retail/Products/9wzdncrfhvjl/applockerdata`.\n\nMicrosoft Edge shows the information that you want; in Internet Explorer, choose **Open** to see the information. The PFN value is given on the first line. Here are the results for our example:\n\n\n`{`\n`  \"packageFamilyName\": \"Microsoft.Office.OneNote_8wekyb3d8bbwe\",`\n`  \"packageIdentityName\": \"Microsoft.Office.OneNote\",`\n`  \"windowsPhoneLegacyId\": \"ca05b3ab-f157-450c-8c49-a1f127f5e71d\",`\n`  \"publisherCertificateName\": \"CN=Microsoft Corporation, O=Microsoft Corporation, L=Redmond, S=Washington, C=US\"`\n`}`\n"}
