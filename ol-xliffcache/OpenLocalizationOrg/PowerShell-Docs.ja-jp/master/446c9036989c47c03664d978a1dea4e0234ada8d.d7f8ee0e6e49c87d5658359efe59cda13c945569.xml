provides a mechanism to manage local groups on the target node.\n\n##Syntax##\n```\nGroup [string] #ResourceName\n{\n    GroupName = [string]\n    [ Credential = [PSCredential] ]\n    [ Description = [string[]] ]\n    [ Ensure = [string] { Absent | Present }  ]\n    [ Members = [string[]] ]\n    [ MembersToExclude = [string[]] ]\n    [ MembersToInclude = [string[]] ]\n    [ DependsOn = [string[]]

to access remote resources. **Note**: This account must have the appropriate Active Directory permissions to add all non-local accounts to the group; otherwise, an error will occur.\n| Description| The description of the group.| \n| Ensure| Indicates if the group exists. Set this property to \"Absent\" to ensure that the group does not exist. Setting it to \"Present\" (the default value) ensures that the group exists.| \n| Members| Use this property to replace the current group membership with the specified members. The value of this property is an array of strings of the form *Domain*\\\\*UserName*. If you set this property in a configuration, do not use either the **MembersToExclude** or **MembersToInclude** property. Doing so will generate an error.| \n| MembersToExclude| Use this property to remove members from the existing membership of the group. The value of this property is an array of strings of the form *Domain*\\\\*UserName*. If you set this property in a configuration, do not use the **Members** property. Doing so will generate an error.| \n| MembersToInclude| Use this property to add members to the existing membership of the group. The value of this property is an array of strings of the form *Domain*\\\\*UserName*. If you set this property in a configuration, do not use the **Members** property.
