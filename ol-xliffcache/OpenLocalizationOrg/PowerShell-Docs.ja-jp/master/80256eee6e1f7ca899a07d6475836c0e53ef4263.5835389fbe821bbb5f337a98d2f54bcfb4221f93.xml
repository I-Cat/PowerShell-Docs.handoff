ATA - Step 1\n\n>[!div class=\"step-by-step\"]\n[Step 2 »](install-ata-step2.md)\n\nThis installation procedure provides instructions for performing a fresh installation of ATA 1.7. For information on updating an existing ATA deployment from an earlier version, see [the ATA migration guide for version 1.7](/advanced-threat-analytics/understand-explore/ata-update-1.7-migration-guide).\n\n> [!IMPORTANT] \n> If using Windows 2012 R2, you can install KB2934520 on the ATA Center server and on the ATA Gateway servers before beginning installation, otherwise the ATA installation will install this update and will require a restart in the middle of the ATA installation.\n\n## Step 1. Download and Install the ATA Center\nAfter you have verified that the server meets the requirements, you can proceed with the installation of the ATA Center.\n\nPerform the following steps on the ATA Center server.\n\n1.  Download ATA from the [Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx) or from the [TechNet Evaluation Center](http://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/) or from [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/downloads).\n\n2.  Log in to the computer onto which you are installing the ATA Center as a user who is a member of the local administrators group.\n\n3.  Run **Microsoft ATA Center Setup.EXE** and follow the setup wizard.\n\n4.  If Microsoft .Net Framework is not installed, you will be prompted to install it when you start installation. You may be prompted to reboot after .NET Framework installation.\n5.  On the **Welcome** page, select the language to be used for the ATA installation screens and click **Next**.\n\n6.  Read the Microsoft Software License Terms and if you accept the terms, click the check box and then click **Next**.\n\n7.  It is recommended that you set ATA to update automatically. If Windows isn't set to do this on your computer, you will get the **Use Microsoft Update to help keep your computer secure and up to date** screen. \n    ![Keep ATA up to date image](media/ata_ms_update.png)\n\n8. Select **Use Microsoft Update when I check for updates (recommended)**. This will adjust the Windows settings to enable updates for other Microsoft products (including ATA), as seen here. \n    ![Windows auto-update image](media/ata_installupdatesautomatically.png)\n\n8.  On the **ATA Center Configuration** page, enter the following information based on your environment:\n\n    |Field|Description|Comments|\n    |---------|---------------|------------|\n    |Installation Path|This is the location where the ATA Center will be installed.

Click **Install** to install the ATA Center and its components.\n    The following components are installed and configured during the installation of ATA Center:\n\n    -   ATA Center service\n\n    -   MongoDB\n\n    -   Custom Performance Monitor data collection set\n\n    -   Self-signed certificates (if selected during the installation)\n\n11.  When the installation completes, click **Launch**  to connect to the ATA Console.\nAt this point you will be brought automatically to the **General** settings page to continue the configuration and the deployment of the ATA Gateways.\nBecause you are logging into the site using an IP address, you will receive a warning related to the certificate, this is normal and you should click **Continue to this website**.\n\n### Validate installation\n\n1.  Check to see that the service named **Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics Center** is running.\n2.  On the desktop, click the **Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics** shortcut to connect to the ATA Console. Log in with the same user credentials that you used to install the ATA Center.\n\n\n\n>[!div class=\"step-by-step\"]\n[« Pre-install](preinstall-ata.md)\n[Step 2 »](install-ata-step2.md)\n\n## See Also\n\n- [Check out the ATA forum!](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/security/home?forum=mata)\n- [Configure event collection](configure-event-collection.md)\n- [ATA prerequisites](/advanced-threat-analytics/plan-design/ata-prerequisites)\n\n"}
