For example, if the configuration MOF is located at `C:\\DSC\\Configurations\\localhost.mof`, \nyou would apply it to the local machine with the following command: `Start-DscConfiguration -Path 'C:\\DSC\\Configurations'`\n\n> __Note__: By default, DSC runs a configuration as a background job. To run the configuration interactively, call the \n>[Start-DscConfiguration](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn521623.aspx) with the __-Wait__ parameter.\n\n\n## Pull mode\n\n![Pull Mode](images/Pull.png \"How pull mode works\")\n\nIn pull mode, pull clients are configured to get their desired state configurations from a remote pull server. Likewise, the pull server has been set up to host the DSC service, and \nhas been provisioned with the configurations and resources that are required by the pull clients. Each one of the pull clients has a scheduled task that performs a periodic compliance \ncheck on the configuration of the node. When the event is triggered the first time, it causes the Local Configuration Manager (LCM) on the pull client to validate the configuration. \nIf the pull client is configured as desired, nothing happens. Otherwise, the LCM makes a request to the pull server to get a given configuration. If that configuration exists on the pull \nserver, and it passes initial validation checks, the configuration is transmitted to the pull client, where it is then executed by the LCM.\n\nFor more information on deploying a DSC Pull Server on premises, see the DSC Pull Server Configuration and Planning Guide.\n\nIf you would prefer to take advantage of an online service to host Pull Server functionality, see the [Azure Automation DSC](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/automation-dsc-overview/) service.\n\nThe following topics explain how to set up pull servers and clients:\n\n- [Setting up a web pull server](pullServer.md)\n- [Setting up an SMB pull server](pullServerSMB.md)\n- [Configuring a pull client](pullClientConfigID.md)\n\n"}
