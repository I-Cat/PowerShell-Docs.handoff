Microsoft Intune\n\nThis topic explains some of the concepts you need to understand before you start deploying apps with Microsoft Intune.\n\n\n## App deployment actions\nWhen you deploy apps, you can choose from one of the following deployment actions:\n\n-   **Required install** – The app is installed onto the device with no user intervention required.\n\n    > [!TIP]\n    > For iOS devices that are not in supervised mode, and for all Android devices, the user must accept the app offer before it is installed.\n    >\n    >  If a user uninstalls an app that you deployed as a required install, Intune automatically reinstalls the app after the next inventory cycle, which typically occurs every seven days.\n\n-   **Available install** – The app is displayed in the company portal, and users can install it on demand.\n\n-   **Uninstall** – The app is uninstalled from the device.\n\n-   **Not applicable** – The app is not displayed in the company portal and is not installed on any devices.\n\n#### Understand which deployment actions are available for each installer type\n\n|Installer type|Required install|Available install|Uninstall|Not applicable|\n|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------|------------------|\n|Windows app package (deployed to a user group)|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n|Windows app package (deployed to a device group)|Yes|No|Yes|Yes|\n|App package for mobile devices (deployed to a user group)|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n|App package for mobile devices (deployed to a device group)|Yes|No|Yes|Yes|\n|Windows Installer (deployed to a user group)|No|Yes|No|Yes|\n|Windows Installer (deployed to a device group)|Yes|No|Yes|Yes|\n|External link (deployed to a user group)|No|Yes|No|Yes|\n|External link (deployed to a device group)|No|No|No|No|\n|Managed iOS app from the app store (deployed to a user group)|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n|Managed iOS app from the app store (deployed to a device group)|Yes|No|Yes|Yes|\n> [!TIP]\n> When you deploy apps, if you select both user and device groups, you can only deploy the app as an **Available install**.\n\n## Deployment conflicts\nWhen two deployments with the same deployment action are received by a device, the following rules apply:\n\n-   Deployments to a device group take precedence over deployments to a user group. However, if an app is deployed to a user group with a deployment action of **Available**, and the same app is also deployed to a device group with a deployment action of **Not Applicable**, the app will be made available in the company portal for users to install.\n\n-   An install action takes precedence over an uninstall action.\n\n-   If both a required and an available install are received by a device, the actions are combined. In other words, the user can install the available app from the company portal before the required install begins.\n\n\n## Next steps\n\nLearn how to [deploy apps in Microsoft Intune](deploy-apps-in-microsoft-intune.md).\n"}
