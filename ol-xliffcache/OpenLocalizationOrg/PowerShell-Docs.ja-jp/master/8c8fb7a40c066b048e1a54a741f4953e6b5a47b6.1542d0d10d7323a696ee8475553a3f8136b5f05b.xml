If __Checksum__ is not specified, only the file or directory name is used for comparison. Valid values include: SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, createdDate, modifiedDate.| \n| Contents| Specifies the contents of a file, such as a particular string.| \n| Credential| Indicates the credentials that are required to access resources, such as source files, if such access is required.| \n| Ensure| Indicates if the file or directory exists. Set this property to \"Absent\" to ensure that the file or directory does not exist. Set it to \"Present\" to ensure that the file or directory does exist.

For example, if the ID of the resource configuration script block that you want to run first is __ResourceName__ and its type is __ResourceType__, the syntax for using this property is `DependsOn = \"[ResourceType]ResourceName\"`.| \n| SourcePath| Indicates the path from which to copy the file or folder resource.| \n| Type| Indicates if the resource being configured is a directory or a file. Set this property to \"Directory\" to indicate that the resource is a directory. Set it to \"File\" to indicate that the resource is a file.

The default value is **$false**.| \n\n## Example\n\nThe following example shows how to use the File resource to ensure that a directory with the path `C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\DSCDemo\\DemoSource` on a source computer (such as the “pull” server) is also present (along with all subdirectories) on the target node. It also writes a confirmatory message to the log when complete and includes a statement to ensure that the file-checking operation runs prior to the logging operation.\n\n```powershell\nConfiguration FileResourceDemo\n{\n    Node \"localhost\"\n    {\n        File DirectoryCopy\n        {\n            Ensure = \"Present\"  # You can also set Ensure to \"Absent\"\n            Type = \"Directory\" # Default is \"File\".\n            Recurse = $true # Ensure presence of subdirectories, too\n            SourcePath = \"C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\DSCDemo\\DemoSource\"\n            DestinationPath = \"C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\DSCDemo\\DemoDestination\"    \n        }\n\n        Log AfterDirectoryCopy\n        {\n            # The message below gets written to the Microsoft-Windows-Desired State Configuration/Analytic log\n            Message = \"Finished running the file resource with ID DirectoryCopy\"\n            DependsOn = \"[File]DirectoryCopy\" # This means run \"DirectoryCopy\" first.\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n"}
