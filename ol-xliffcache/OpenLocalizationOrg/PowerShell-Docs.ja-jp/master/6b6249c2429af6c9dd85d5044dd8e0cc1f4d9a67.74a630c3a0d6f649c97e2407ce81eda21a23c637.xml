ways:\n\n- **[Automatic enrollment with Azure AD](#azure-active-directory-enrollment)** -  Windows 10 and Window 10 Mobile users enroll their devices by adding a work or school account to the device\n- **[Company Portal enrollment](#company-portal-app-enrollment)** - Windows 8.1 and later devices are enrolled by downloading and installing the Company Portal app, and then entering their work or school account credentials in the app.\n\n[!INCLUDE[AAD-enrollment](../includes/win10-automatic-enrollment-aad.md)]\n\n## Configure Company Portal app enrollment\nYou can let users enroll their devices by installing and enrolling their devices with the Intune Company Portal app. Creating a DNS CNAME helps users connect and enroll in Intune without entering a server name.\n\n1. **Set up Intune**<br>\nIf you haven’t already, prepare for mobile device management by  [setting the mobile device management authority](get-ready-to-enroll-devices-in-microsoft-intune.md#set-mobile-device-management-authority) as **Microsoft Intune** and setting up MDM.\n\n2. **Create CNAMEs** (optional)<br>Create **CNAME** DNS resource records for your company’s domain to simplify enrollment. Although creating CNAME DNS entries is optional, creating CNAME records makes enrollment easier for users. If no enrollment CNAME record is found, users are prompted to manually enter the MDM server name, `https://manage.microsoft.com`.  The CNAME resource records must contain the following information:\n\n  |TYPE|Host name|Points to|TTL|\n  |--------|-------------|-------------|-------|\n  |CNAME|EnterpriseEnrollment.company_domain.com|EnterpriseEnrollment-s.manage.microsoft.com |1 Hour|\n  |CNAME|EnterpriseRegistration.company_domain.com|EnterpriseRegistration.windows.net|1 Hour|\n\n  `EnterpriseEnrollment-s.manage.microsoft.com` – Supports a redirect to the Intune service with domain recognition from the email’s domain name\n\n  `EnterpriseRegistration.windows.net` – Supports Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 Mobile devices that will register with Azure Active Directory using their work or school account\n\n  If your company uses multiple domains for user credentials, create CNAME records for each domain.\n\n  For example, if your company’s website is contoso.com, you would create a CNAME in DNS that redirects EnterpriseEnrollment.contoso.com to EnterpriseEnrollment-s.manage.microsoft.com. DNS record changes might take up to 72 hours to propagate. You cannot verify the DNS change in Intune until the DNS record propagates.\n\n3.  **Verify CNAME**<br>In the [Intune administration console](http://manage.microsoft.com), click **Admin** &gt; **Mobile Device Management** &gt; **Windows**. Type the URL of the verified domain of the company website in the **Specify a verified domain name** box and then click **Test Auto-Detection**.\n\n  ![Windows device management dialog box](../media/enroll-intune-winenr.png)\n\n4.  **Optional steps**<br>The **Add Sideloading keys** step is not needed for Windows 10. The **Upload Code-Signing Certificate** step is only needed if you will distribute line-of-business (LOB) apps to devices not available from the Windows Store.
