Set this property to \"Present\" to ensure the group exists. Set it to \"Absent\" to ensure the group does not exist. The default value is \"Present\".| \n| Members| Specifies the members that form the group.| \n| MembersToInclude| Specifies the users who you want to ensure are members of the group.| \n| MembersToExclude| Specifies the users who you want to ensure are not members of the group.| \n| PreferredGroupID| Sets the group id to the provided value if possible. If the group id is currently in use, the next available group id is used.| \n| DependsOn | Indicates that the configuration of another resource must run before this resource is configured. For example, if the **ID** of the resource configuration script block that you want to run first is **ResourceName** and its type is **ResourceType**, the syntax for using this property is `DependsOn = \"[ResourceType]ResourceName\"`.| \n\n## Example\n\nThe following example ensures that the user “monuser” exists and is a member of the group \"DBusers\".\n\n```\nImport-DSCResource -Module nx \n\nNode $node {\n\nnxUser UserExample{\n   UserName = \"monuser\"\n   Description = \"Monitoring user\"\n   Password  =    '$6$fZAne/Qc$MZejMrOxDK0ogv9SLiBP5J5qZFBvXLnDu8HY1Oy7ycX.Y3C7mGPUfeQy3A82ev3zIabhDQnj2ayeuGn02CqE/0'\n   Ensure = \"Present\"\n   HomeDirectory = \"/home/monuser\"\n}\n \nnxGroup GroupExample{\n   GroupName = \"DBusers\"\n   Ensure = \"Present\"\n   MembersToInclude = \"monuser\"\n   DependsOn = \"[nxUser]UserExample\"            \n}\n}\n```\n\n"}
