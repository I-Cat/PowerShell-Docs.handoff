A resource exposes properties that can be configured (schema) and contains the PowerShell script functions that the Local Configuration Manager (LCM) calls to \"make it so\".\n\nA resource can model something as generic as a file or as specific as an IIS server setting.  Groups of like resources are combined in to a DSC Module, which organizes all the required files in to a structure that is portable and includes metadata to identify how the resources are intended to be used.  \n\nThe following topics describe DSC resources:\n\n- [Built-In DSC resources](builtInResource.md)\n- [Build custom DSC resources](authoringResource.md)\n- [Built-In DSC resources for Linux](lnxBuiltInResources.md)\n\n"}
