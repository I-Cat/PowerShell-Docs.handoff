You can include it with the -IncludeExtent parameter.\n\n-   Many learning algorithm bug fixes from MVP and community feedback.\n\n-   A new -UpdateTemplate parameter to save the results of the learning algorithm into a comment in the template file. This makes the learning process (the slowest stage) a one-time cost. Running Convert-String with a template that contains the encoded learning algorithm is now nearly instantaneous.\n\n\nExtract and parse structured objects out of string content\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn collaboration with [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/), a new **ConvertFrom-String** cmdlet has been added.\n\nThis cmdlet supports two modes: basic delimited parsing, and auto generated example-driven parsing.\n\nDelimited parsing, by default, splits the input at white space, and assigns property names to the resulting groups. You can customize the delimiter:\n\n> 1 \\[C:\\\\temp\\]\n> &gt;&gt; \"Hello World\" | ConvertFrom-String | Format-Table -Auto\n\nP1    P2\n--    --\n\nThe cmdlet also supports auto-generated example-driven parsing based on the [FlashExtract](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/sumitg/flashextract.html) research work in [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com).\n\nTo get started, consider a text-based address book:\n\n    Ana Trujillo\n\n    Redmond, WA\n\n    Antonio Moreno\n\n    Renton, WA\n\n    Thomas Hardy\n\n    Seattle, WA\n\n    Christina Berglund\n\n    Redmond, WA\n\n    Hanna Moos\n\n    Puyallup, WA\n\nCopy a few examples into a file, which you will use as your template:\n\n    Ana Trujillo\n\n    Redmond, WA\n\n    Antonio Moreno\n\n    Renton, WA\n\n   \n\nPut curly braces around data that you want to extract, giving it a name as you do so. Because the **Name** property (and its associated other properties) can appear multiple times, use an asterisk (\\*) to indicate that this results in multiple records (rather than extracting a bunch of properties into one record):\n\n    {Name\\*:Ana Trujillo}\n\n    {City:Redmond}, {State:WA}\n\n    {Name\\*:Antonio Moreno}\n\n    {City:Renton}, {State:WA}\n\nFrom this set of examples, **ConvertFrom-String** can now automatically extract object-based output from input files with similar structure.\n\n> 2 \\[C:\\\\temp\\]\n>\n> &gt;&gt; Get-Content .\\\\addresses.output.txt | ConvertFrom-String -TemplateFile .\\\\addresses.template.txt |\n> &gt;&gt;&gt; Format-Table -Auto\n>\n> ExtentText                     Name               City     State\n> ----------                     ----               ----     -----\n> Ana Trujillo...
