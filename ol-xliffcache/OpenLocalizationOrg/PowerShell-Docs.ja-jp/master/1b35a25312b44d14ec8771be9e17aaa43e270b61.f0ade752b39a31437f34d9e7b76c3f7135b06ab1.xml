implemented for PowerShell 5.1:\n\n\n## Performance ##\n\nPerformance has improved in some important areas:\n\n1. Startup\n2. Pipelining to cmdlets like ForEach-Object and Where-Object is approximately 50% faster \n\nSome example improvements (results may vary depending on your hardware): \n\n| Scenario | 5.0 Time (ms) | 5.1 Time (ms) |\n| -------- | :---------------: | :---------------: |\n| `powershell -command \"echo 1\"` | 900 | 250 |\n| First ever PowerShell run: `powershell -command \"Unknown-Command\"` | 30000 | 13000 |\n| Command analysis cache built: `powershell -command \"Unknown-Command\"` | 7000 | 520 |\n| <code>1..1000000 &#124; % { }</code> | 1400 | 750 |\n  \nOne change related to startup may impact some (unsupported) scenarios. PowerShell no longer\nreads the files `$pshome\\*.ps1xml` - these files have been converted to C# to avoid some file\nand CPU overhead of processing the XML files. The files still exist to support V2 side-by-side,\nso if you change the file contents, it will not have any effect to V5, only V2. Note that changing\nthe contents of these files was never a supported scenario.\n\nAnother visible change is how PowerShell caches the exported commands and other information for\nmodules that are installed on a system. Previous, this cache was stored in the directory\n`$env:LOCALAPPDATA\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\CommandAnalysis`. In WMF 5.1, the cache is a single\nfile `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\ModuleAnalysisCache`.\nSee [analysis_cache.md]() for more details.\n\nStarting with version 5.1, PowerShell is available in different editions which denote varying feature sets and platform compatibility.\n\n\n\n## Bug Fixes ##\n\nThe following notable bugs were fixed:\n\n### Module auto-discovery fully honors `$env:PSModulePath` ###\n\nModule auto-discovery (loading modules automatically without an explicit Import-Module when calling a command)\nwas introduced in WMF3. When introduced, PowerShell checked for commands in `$PSHome\\Modules` before\nusing `$env:PSModulePath`.\n\nWMF5.1 changes this behavior to honor `$env:PSModulePath` completely. This allows for a user-authored module \nthat defines commands provided by PowerShell (e.g. `Get-ChildItem`) to be auto-loaded and correctly overriding\nthe built-in command.\n\n### File redirection no longer hard-codes `-Encoding Unicode` ###\n\nIn all previous versions of PowerShell, it was impossible to control the file encoding used by the file\nredirection operator, e.g. `Get-ChildItem > out.txt` because PowerShell added `-Encoding Unicode`.\n\nStarting with WMF 5.1, you can now change the file encoding of redirection by setting `$PSDefaultParameterValues`, e.g.\n\n```\n$PSDefaultParameterValues[\"Out-File:Encoding\"] = \"Ascii\"\n```\n\n### Fixed a regression in accessing members of `System.Reflection.TypeInfo` ###\n\nA regression introduced in WMF5 broke accessing members of `System.Reflection.RuntimeType`, e.g. `[int].ImplementedInterfaces`.\nThis bug has been fixed in WMF 5.1.\n\n\n### Fixed some issues with COM objects ###\n\nWMF5 introduced a new COM binder for invoking methods on COM objects and accessing properties of COM objects.\nThis new binder improved performance significantly but also introduced some bugs which have been fixed in WMF 5.1.\n\n#### Argument conversions were not always performed correctly ####\n\nIn the following example:\n\n```\n$obj = New-Object -ComObject WScript.Shell\n$obj.SendKeys([char]173)\n```\n\nThe SendKeys method expects a string, but PowerShell did not convert the char to a string, deferring the conversion\nto IDispatch::Invoke, which uses VariantChangeType to do the conversion, which in this example resulted in sending\nthe keys '1', '7', and '3' instead of the expected Volume.Mute key.\n\n#### Enumerable COM objects not always handled correctly ####\n\nPowerShell normally enumerates most enumerable objects, but a regression introduced in WMF5 prevented the enumeration\nof COM objects that implement IEnumerable.  For example:\n\n```\nfunction Get-COMDictionary\n{\n    $d = New-Object -ComObject Scripting.Dictionary\n    $d.Add('a', 2)\n    $d.Add('b', 2)\n    return $d\n}\n\n$x = Get-COMDictionary\n```\n\nIn the above example, WMF5 incorrectly wrote the Scripting.Dictionary to the pipeline\ninstead of enumerating the key value pairs.\n\n\n### `[ordered]` was not allowed inside classes ###\n\nWMF5 introduced classes with validation of type literals used in classes.  `[ordered]` looks like a type\nliteral but is not a true .NET type.  WMF5 incorrectly reported an error on `[ordered]` inside a class:\n\n```\nclass CThing\n{\n    [object] foo($i)\n    {\n        [ordered]@{ Thing = $i }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n### Help on about topics with multiple versions does not work ###\n\nBefore WMF5.1, if you had multiple versions of a module installed and they all shared a help topic,\ne.g. about_PSReadline, `help about_PSReadline` would return multiple topics with no obvious way\nto view the real help.\n\nWMF5.1 fixes this by returning the help for the latest version of the topic.\n\nGet-Help does not provide a way to specify which version you want help for, the workaround is to\nnavigate to the modules directory and view the help directly with a tool like your favorite editor. \n"}
