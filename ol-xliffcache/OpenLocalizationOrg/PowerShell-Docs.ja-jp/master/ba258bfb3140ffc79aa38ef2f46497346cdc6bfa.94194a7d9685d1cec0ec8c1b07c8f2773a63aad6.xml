below can be [configured](create-and-deploy-mobile-app-management-policies-with-microsoft-intune.md) for a MAM policy on the **Settings** blade on the Azure portal.\n\nThere are two categories of policy settings, Data relocation and Access settings:\n\n##  Data relocation settings\nThe term **Policy managed apps** is used to refer to apps that are configured with MAM policies.\n\n- **Prevent iTunes and iCloud backups:**\n  Choose **Yes** to disable, or **No** to allow backup of company data from the policy managed apps.\n\n  **Default value = Yes**\n\n- **Allow app to transfer data to other apps:**   Choose one of the options to indicate the apps that can receive data from policy managed apps:\n  - **Policy managed apps**: Allow transfer to only apps that have the MAM policy.\n  - **All apps**: Allow transfer to any app\n  - **None**: Do not allow data transfer to any app including other policy managed apps.\n\n  Additionally, if you set this option to **Policy Managed Apps** or **None**, the iOS 9 feature that allows Spotlight Search to search data within apps will be blocked.\n\n  **This setting does not control use of the Open In feature on mobile devices. To manage Open In, see [here](manage-data-transfer-between-ios-apps-with-microsoft-intune.md)**.\n\n  **Default value = Policy managed apps**\n\n- **Allow app to receive data from other apps:**  Specify apps that are allowed to transfer data to the policy managed apps:\n  -  **Policy managed apps**: Allow data transfers only from other policy managed apps.\n  -  **All apps**: Allow data transfer from any app\n  -  **None**: Do not allow data transfer from any app.\n\n  **Default value = All apps**\n\n- **Prevent Save As:**\n  Choose **Yes** to disable the use of the Save As option in any app that uses this policy. Choose **No** if you want to allow the use of Save As.\n\n  **Default value = Yes**\n\n- **Restrict cut, copy and paste with other apps:**\nSpecify when  cut, copy, and paste operations should be restricted. Choose from:\n  -   **Blocked:** Do not allow cut, copy, and paste operations between policy managed apps.\n  -   **Policy Managed Apps**: Only allow cut, copy, and paste operations between policy managed apps.\n  -   **Policy Managed Apps with paste In**: Allow cut or copy between policy managed apps. Allow cut or copied data from any app to be pasted into this app.\n  - **Any App**: No restrictions for  cut, copy, and paste operations between any apps.\n\n  **Default value =Policy managed apps with paste in**\n\n- **Restrict web content to display in the Managed Browser:** When this setting is enabled, any links in the app will be opened in the Managed Browser.\n\n  For devices that are not enrolled in Intune, the web links in policy-managed apps can only open in the Managed Browser app using the mobile app management policy.\n\n  If you are using Intune to manage your devices, see [manage internet access using managed browser policies with Microsoft Intune](manage-internet-access-using-managed-browser-policies.md).\n\n    **Default value = Yes**\n\n- **Encrypt app data:** For apps that are associated with an [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] mobile app management policy, data is encrypted at rest using device level encryption provided by the OS. When a PIN is required, the data is encrypted per the settings in the mobile app management policy. As stated in Apple documentation, [the modules used by iOS 7 are FIPS 140-2 certified](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202739).\n\n  In the policy settings, you can specify PIN encryption values.  These values determine when the data is encrypted. The options are:\n  - **When device is locked:** All app data associated with this policy is encrypted while the device is locked.\n  -   **When device is locked (except for open files):** All app data associated with this policy is encrypted while the device is locked, except for data that in the files that are currently open in the app.\n  -   **After device restart:** All app data associated with this policy is encrypted when the device is restarted, until the device is unlocked for the first time.\n  -   **Use device settings:** App data is encrypted based on the default settings on the device.\n  When you enable this setting, the end user is required to setup and use a PIN to access their device.  If there is no PIN, the apps will not launch and the end user will be prompted to set a PIN with a message -“Your company has required that you must first enable a device PIN to access this application.”\n\n  **Default value -Encryption option is not selected.**\n- **Disable contact sync:**  Choose **Yes** to prevent contact information from synchronizing to the native address book app on the device. If you choose **No**, the app will save the  contact information to the native address book app on the device.\n\n  When you do a selective wipe to remove company data, contacts synced directly from the app to the native address book are removed. Any contacts synced from the native address book to another external source cannot be wiped. Currently this is applicable only to the **Microsoft Outlook** app.\n\n  **Default value = Yes**\n##  iOS Access policy settings\nThe term **Policy managed apps** is used to refer to apps that are configured with MAM policies.\n- **Require PIN for access:**  Choose **Yes** to require a PIN to use policy managed apps.
