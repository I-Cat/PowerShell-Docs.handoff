A binary module may or may not include a module manifest.|\n|common parameter|A parameter that is added to all cmdlets and advanced functions by the Windows PowerShell engine.|\n|dot source|In Windows PowerShell, to start a command by typing a dot and a space before the command. Commands that are dot sourced run in the current scope instead of in a new scope. Any variables, aliases, functions, or drives that command creates are created in the current scope and are available to users when the command is completed.|\n|dynamic module|A module that exists only in memory. The New-Module and Import-PSSession cmdlets create dynamic modules.|\n|dynamic parameter|A parameter that is added to a Windows PowerShell cmdlet, function, or script under certain conditions. Cmdlets, functions, providers, and scripts can add dynamic parameters.|\n|formatting file|A Windows PowerShell XML file that has the .format.ps1xml extension and that defines how Windows PowerShell displays an object based on its .NET Framework type.|\n|global session state|The session state that contains the data that is accessible to the user of a Windows PowerShell session.|\n|host|The interface that the Windows PowerShell engine uses to communicate with the user.

The private data in this session state is not available to the user of a Windows PowerShell session.|\n|non-terminating error|An error that does not stop Windows PowerShell from continuing to process the command.|\n|noun|The word that follows the hyphen in a Windows PowerShell cmdlet name. The noun describes the resources upon which the cmdlet acts.|\n|parameter set|A group of parameters that can be used in the same command to perform a specific action.|\n|pipe|In Windows PowerShell, to send the results of the preceding command as input to the next command in the pipeline.|\n|pipeline|A series of commands connected by pipeline operators (&#124;) (ASCII 124). Each pipeline operator sends the results of the preceding command as input to the next command.|\n|PSSession|A type of Windows PowerShell session that is created, managed, and closed by the user.|\n|root module|The module specified in the ModuleToProcess key in a module manifest.|\n|runspace|In Windows PowerShell, the operating environment in which each command in a pipeline is executed.|\n|script block|In the Windows PowerShell programming language, a collection of statements or expressions that can be used as a single unit. A script block can accept arguments and return values.|\n|script module|A Windows PowerShell module whose root module is a script module file (.psm1). A script module may or may not include a module manifest.|\n|script module file|A file that contains a Windows PowerShell script. The script defines the members that the script module exports. Script module files have the .psm1 file name extension.|\n|shell|The command interpreter that is used to pass commands to the operating system.|\n|switch parameter|A parameter that does not take an argument.|\n|terminating error|An error that stops Windows PowerShell from processing the command.|\n|transaction|An atomic unit of work.

The verb describes the action that the cmdlet performs.|\n|Windows PowerShell|A command-line shell and task-based scripting technology that provides IT administrators comprehensive control and automation of system administration tasks.|\n|Windows PowerShell command|The elements in a pipeline that cause an action to be carried out. Windows PowerShell commands are either typed at the keyboard or invoked programmatically.|\n|Windows PowerShell data file|A text file that has the .psd1 file name extension. Windows PowerShell uses data files for various purposes such as storing module manifest data and storing translated strings for script internationalization.|\n|Windows PowerShell drive|A virtual drive that provides direct access to a data store. It can be defined by a Windows PowerShell provider or created at the command line. Drives created at the command line are session-specific drives and are lost when the session is closed.|\n|Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE)|A Windows PowerShell host application that enables you to run commands and to write, test, and debug scripts in a friendly, syntax-colored, Unicode-compliant environment.|\n|Windows PowerShell module|A self-contained reusable unit that allows you to partition, organize, and abstract your Windows PowerShell  code.
