managed with PowerShell.\nWith JEA, you can:\n- **Reduce the number of administrators on your machines** by leveraging virtual accounts that perform privileged actions on behalf of regular users.\n- **Limit what users can do** by specifying which cmdlets, functions, and external commands they can run.\n- **Better understand what your users are doing** with \"over the shoulder\" transcriptions that show you exactly what commands a user executed during a session.\n\n**Why is this important?**  \nConsider the common scenario where your DNS servers are co-located with your Active Directory Domain Controllers.\nYour DNS administrators need to have local administrator privileges to fix issues with the DNS server, but in order to do so you have to make them members of the highly privileged \"Domain Admins\" security group.\nThis approach effectively gives DNS Administrators control over your whole domain and access to all resources on that machine.\n\nWith JEA in place, you can configure a role for your DNS administrators that gives them access to all the commands they need to get their job done, but nothing more.\nThis means you can provide the appropriate access to repair a poisoned DNS cache without unintentionally giving them rights to Active Directory, or to browse the file system, or run potentially dangerous scripts.\nBetter yet, when the JEA session is configured to use one-time privileged virtual accounts, your DNS administrators can connect to the server using *unprivileged* credentials and still be able to run privileged commands.\n\n## Availability\nJEA is
