(For more information, see [Built-In Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration Resources](builtInResource.md).) This topic provides an overview of developing resources and links to topics with specific information and examples.\n\n## DSC resource components\n\nA DSC resource is a Windows PowerShell module. The module contains both the schema (the definition of the configurable properties) and the implementation (the code that does the actual work specified by a configuration) for the resource. A DSC resource schema can be defined in a MOF file, and the implementation is performed by a script module. Beginning with the support of PowerShell classes in version 5, the schema and implementation can both be defined in a class. The following topics describe in more detail how to create DSC resources.\n\n* [Writing a custom DSC resource with MOF](authoringResourceMOF.md) \n* [Implementing a DSC resource in C#](authoringResourceMofCS.md) \n* [Writing a custom DSC resource with PowerShell classes](authoringResourceClass.md) \n* [Composite resources: Using a DSC configuration as a resource](authoringResourceComposite.md) \n* [Using the Resource Designer tool](authoringResourceMofDesigner.md) \n"}
