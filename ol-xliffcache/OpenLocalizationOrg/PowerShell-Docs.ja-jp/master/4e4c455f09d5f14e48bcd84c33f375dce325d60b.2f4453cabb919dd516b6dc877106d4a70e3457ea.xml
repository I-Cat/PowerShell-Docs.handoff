in your environment.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n> For information on how to plan resources and capacity, see [ATA capacity planning](ata-capacity-planning.md).\n\n\nATA is comprised of the ATA Center, the ATA Gateway and/or the ATA Lightweight Gateway. For more information about the ATA components, see [ATA architecture](ata-architecture.md).\n\nThe ATA System works on active directory forest boundary and supports Forest Functional Level (FFL) of Windows 2003 and above.\n\n\n[Before you start](#before-you-start): This section lists information you should gather and accounts and network entities you should have before starting ATA installation.\n\n[ATA Center](#ata-center-requirements): This section lists ATA Center hardware, software requirements as well as settings  you need to configure on your ATA Center server.\n\n[ATA Gateway](#ata-gateway-requirements): This section lists ATA Gateway hardware, software requirements as well as settings  you need to configure on your ATA Gateway servers.\n\n[ATA Lightweight Gateway](#ata-lightweight-gateway-requirements): This section lists ATA Lightweight Gateway hardware, and software requirements.\n\n[ATA Console](#ata-console): This section lists browser requirements for running the ATA Console.\n\n![ATA architecture diagram](media/ATA-architecture-topology.jpg)\n\n## Before you start\nThis section lists information you should gather and accounts and network entities you should have before starting ATA installation.\n\n\n-   User account and password with read access to all objects in the domains that will be monitored.\n\n    > [!NOTE]\n    > If you have set custom ACLs on various Organizational Units (OU) in your domain, make sure that the selected user has read permissions to those OUs.\n\n-   Make sure that Message Analyzer and WireShark are not installed on the ATA Gateway.\n-    Recommended: User should have read only permissions on the Deleted Objects container. This will allow ATA to detect bulk deletion of objects in the domain. For information about configuring read only permissions on the Deleted Objects container, see the **Changing permissions on a deleted object container** section in the [View or Set Permissions on a Directory Object](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc816824%28v=ws.10%29.aspx) topic.\n\n-   Optional: A user account of a user who has no network activities. This account will be configured as the ATA Honeytoken user. To configure the Honeytoken user you will need the SID of the user account, not the username. For more information see [Working with ATA Detection Settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/advanced-threat-analytics/deploy-use/working-with-detection-settings) topic.\n\n-   Optional: In addition to collecting and analyzing network traffic to and from the domain controllers, ATA can use Windows event 4776 to further enhance ATA Pass-the-Hash detection. This can be received from your SIEM or by  setting Windows Event Forwarding from your domain controller. Events collected provide ATA with additional information that is not available via the domain controller network traffic.\n\n\n## ATA Center requirements\nThis section lists the requirements for the ATA Center.\n### General\nThe ATA Center supports installation on a server running Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2016. \nThe ATA Center can be installed on a server that is a member of a domain or workgroup.\n\nBefore installing ATA Center running Windows 2012 R2, confirm that the following update has been installed: [KB2919355](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2919355/).\n\nYou can check by running the following Windows PowerShell cmdlet: `[Get-HotFix -Id kb2919355]`.\n\nInstallation of the ATA Center as a virtual machine is supported. \n\n>[!NOTE] \n> When running as a virtual machine dynamic memory or any other memory ballooning feature is not supported.\n\nIf you run the ATA Center as a virtual machine, shut down the server before creating a new checkpoint to avoid potential database corruption.\n### Server specifications\nWhen working on a physical server, the ATA database necessitates that you **disable** Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) in the BIOS. Your system may refer to NUMA as Node Interleaving, in which case you will have to **enable** Node Interleaving in order to disable NUMA. See your BIOS documentation for more information. Note that this is not relevant when the ATA Center is running on a virtual server.<br>\nFor optimal performance, set the **Power Option** of the ATA Center to **High Performance**.<br>\nThe number of domain controllers you are monitoring and the load on each of the domain controllers dictates the server specifications needed see [ATA capacity planning](ata-capacity-planning.md) for more details.\n\n\n### Time synchronization\nThe ATA Center server, the ATA Gateway servers and the domain controllers must have time synchronized to within 5 minutes of each other.\n\n\n### Network adapters\nYou should have the following:\n-   At least one network adapter (if using physical server in VLAN environment, it is recommended to use two network adapters)\n\n-   Two IP addresses (recommended but not required)\n\nCommunication between the ATA Center and the ATA Gateway is encrypted using SSL on port 443. Additionally, the ATA Console is also using SSL on port 443. **Two IP addresses** are recommended. The ATA Center service will bind port 443 to the first IP address and ATA Console will bind port 443 to the second IP address.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> A single IP address with two different ports can be used, but two IP addresses are recommended.\n\n### Ports\nThe following table lists the minimum ports that have to be opened for the ATA Center to work properly.\n\nIn this table, IP address 1 is bound to the ATA Center service and IP address 2 is bound to the ATA Console:\n\n|Protocol|Transport|Port|To/From|Direction|IP Address|\n|------------|-------------|--------|-----------|-------------|--------------|\n|**SSL** (ATA Communications)|TCP|443, or configurable|ATA Gateway|Inbound|IP address 1|\n|**HTTP**|TCP|80|Company Network|Inbound|IP address 2|\n|**HTTPS**|TCP|443|Company Network and ATA Gateway|Inbound|IP address 2|\n|**SMTP** (optional)|TCP|25|SMTP Server|Outbound|IP address 2|\n|**SMTPS** (optional)|TCP|465|SMTP Server|Outbound|IP address 2|\n|**Syslog** (optional)|TCP|514|Syslog server|Outbound|IP address 2|\n\n### Certificates\nMake sure the ATA Center has access to your CRL distribution point. If the ATA Gateways don't have Internet access, follow [the procedure to manually import a CRL](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/aa996972%28v=exchg.65%29.aspx), taking care to install the all the CRL distribution points for the whole chain.\n\nTo ease the installation of the ATA Center, you can install self-signed certificates during the installation of the ATA Center. Post deployment you can replace the self-signed with a certificate from an internal Certification Authority to be used by the ATA Gateway.<br>\n> [!NOTE]\n> The certificate's Provider Type must be Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP).\n\n\n> Using of automatic certificate renewal is not supported.\n\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you are going to access the ATA Console from other computers, ensure that those computers trust the certificate being used by ATA Center otherwise you will get a warning page that there is a problem with the website's security certificate before getting to the log in page.\n\n## ATA Gateway requirements\nThis section lists the requirements for the ATA Gateway.\n### General\nThe ATA Gateway supports installation on a server running Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2016 (Include server core).\nThe ATA Gateway can be installed on a server that is a member of a domain or workgroup.\nThe ATA Gateway can be used to monitor Domain Controllers with Domain Functional Level of Windows 2003 and above.\n\nBefore installing ATA Gateway running Windows 2012 R2, confirm that the following update has been installed: [KB2919355](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2919355/).\n\nYou can check by running the following Windows PowerShell cmdlet: `[Get-HotFix -Id kb2919355]`.\n\nFor information on using virtual machines with the ATA Gateway, see [Configure port mirroring](/advanced-threat-analytics/deploy-use/configure-port-mirroring).\n\n### Server specifications\nFor optimal performance, set the **Power Option** of the ATA Gateway to **High Performance**.<br>\nAn ATA Gateway can support monitoring multiple domain controllers, depending on the amount of network traffic to and from the domain controllers.\n\n>[!NOTE] \n> When running as a virtual machine dynamic memory or any other memory ballooning feature is not supported.\n\nFor more information about the ATA Gateway hardware requirements see [ATA capacity planning](ata-capacity-planning.md).\n\n### Time synchronization\nThe ATA Center server, the ATA Gateway servers and the domain controllers must have time synchronized to within 5 minutes of each other.\n\n### Network adapters\nThe ATA Gateway requires at least one Management adapter and at least one Capture adapter:\n\n-   **Management adapter** - will be used for communications on your corporate network. This adapter should be configured with the following:\n\n    -   Static IP address including default gateway\n\n    -   Preferred and alternate DNS servers\n\n    -   The **DNS suffix for this connection** should be the DNS name of the domain for each domain being monitored.\n\n        ![Configure DNS suffix in advanced TCP/IP settings](media/ATA-DNS-Suffix.png)\n\n        > [!NOTE]\n        > If the ATA Gateway is a member of the domain, this may be configured automatically.\n\n-   **Capture adapter** - will be used to capture traffic to and from the domain controllers.\n\n    > [!IMPORTANT]\n    > -   Configure port mirroring for the capture adapter as the destination of the domain controller network traffic. See [Configure port mirroring](/advanced-threat-analytics/deploy-use/configure-port-mirroring)  for additional information. Typically, you will need to work with the networking or virtualization team to configure port mirroring.\n    > -   Configure a static non-routable IP address for your environment with no default gateway and no DNS server addresses. For example, 1.1.1.1/32. This will ensure that the capture network adapter can capture the maximum amount of traffic and that the management network adapter is used to send and receive the required network traffic.\n\n### Ports\nThe following table lists the minimum ports that the ATA Gateway requires configured on the management adapter:\n\n|Protocol|Transport|Port|To/From|Direction|\n|------------|-------------|--------|-----------|-------------|\n|LDAP|TCP and UDP|389|Domain controllers|Outbound|\n|Secure LDAP (LDAPS)|TCP|636|Domain controllers|Outbound|\n|LDAP to Global Catalog|TCP|3268|Domain controllers|Outbound|\n|LDAPS to Global Catalog|TCP|3269|Domain controllers|Outbound|\n|Kerberos|TCP and UDP|88|Domain controllers|Outbound|\n|Netlogon|TCP and UDP|445|Domain controllers|Outbound|\n|Windows Time|UDP|123|Domain controllers|Outbound|\n|DNS|TCP and UDP|53|DNS Servers|Outbound|\n|NTLM over RPC|TCP|135|All devices on the network|Outbound|\n|NetBIOS|UDP|137|All devices on the network|Outbound|\n|SSL|TCP|443 or as configured for the Center Service|ATA Center:<br /><br />-   Center Service IP Address<br />-   Console IP Address|Outbound|\n|Syslog (optional)|UDP|514|SIEM Server|Inbound|\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> As part of the resolution process done by the ATA Gateway, the following ports need to be open inbound on devices on the network from the ATA Gateways.\n>\n> -   NTLM over RPC (TCP Port 135)\n> -   NetBIOS (UDP port 137)\n\n### Certificates\nMake sure the ATA Center has access to your CRL distribution point. If the ATA Gateways do not have Internet access, follow the procedure to manually import a CRL, taking care to install the all the CRL distribution points for the whole chain.<br>\nTo ease installation of the ATA Center, you can install self-signed certificates during the installation of the ATA Center. Post deployment you can replace the self-signed with a certificate from an internal Certification Authority to be used by the ATA Gateway.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The certificate's Provider Type must be Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP).<br>\n\nA certificate supporting **Server Authentication** is required to be installed in the Computer store of the ATA Gateway in the Local Computer store. This certificate must be trusted by the ATA Center.\n\n## ATA Lightweight Gateway requirements\nThis section lists the requirements for the ATA Lightweight Gateway.\n### General\nThe ATA Lightweight Gateway supports installation on a domain controller running Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016 (include Core but not Nano).\n\nThe domain controller can be a read only domain controller (RODC).\n\nBefore installing ATA Lightweight Gateway on a domain controller running Windows Server 2012 R2 SP1, confirm that the following update has been installed: [KB2919355](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2919355/).\nYou can check by running the following Windows PowerShell cmdlet: `[Get-HotFix -Id kb2919355]`.\n\n### Server specifications\n\nThe ATA Lightweight Gateway requires a minimum of 2 cores and 6 GB of RAM installed on the domain controller.\nFor optimal performance, set the **Power Option** of the ATA Lightweight Gateway to **High Performance**.\nThe ATA Lightweight Gateway can be deployed on domain controllers of various loads and sizes, depending on the amount of network traffic to and from the domain controllers and the amount of resources installed on that domain controller.\n\n>[!NOTE] \n> When running as a virtual machine dynamic memory or any other memory ballooning feature is not supported.\n\nFor more information about the ATA Lightweight Gateway hardware requirements see [ATA capacity planning](ata-capacity-planning.md).\n\n### Time synchronization\nThe ATA Center server, the ATA Lightweight Gateway servers and the domain controllers must have time synchronized to within 5 minutes of each other.\n### Network adapters\nThe ATA Lightweight Gateway monitors the local traffic on all of the domain controller's network adapters. <br>\nAfter deployment, you can use the ATA Console if you ever want to modify which network adapters are monitored.\n\n### Ports\nThe following table lists the minimum ports that the ATA Lightweight Gateway requires:\n\n|Protocol|Transport|Port|To/From|Direction|\n|------------|-------------|--------|-----------|-------------|\n|DNS|TCP and UDP|53|DNS Servers|Outbound|\n|NTLM over RPC|TCP|135|All devices on the network|Outbound|\n|NetBIOS|UDP|137|All devices on the network|Outbound|\n|SSL|TCP|443 or as configured for the Center Service|ATA Center:<br /><br />-   Center Service IP Address<br />-   Console IP Address|Outbound|\n|Syslog (optional)|UDP|514|SIEM Server|Inbound|\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> As part of the resolution process performed by the ATA Lightweight Gateway, the following ports need to be open inbound on devices on the network from the ATA Lightweight Gateways.\n>\n> -   NTLM over RPC\n> -   NetBIOS\n\n### Certificates\nMake sure the ATA Center has access to your CRL distribution point.
