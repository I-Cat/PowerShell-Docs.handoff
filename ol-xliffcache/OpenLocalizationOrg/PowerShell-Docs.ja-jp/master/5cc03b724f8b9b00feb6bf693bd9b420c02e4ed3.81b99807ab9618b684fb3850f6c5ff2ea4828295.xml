Activation Lock is enabled automatically when a user opens the Find My iPhone app on a device. After it is enabled, the user's Apple ID and password must be entered before anyone can: \n\n-   Turn off Find My iPhone\n\n-   Erase the device\n\n-   Reactivate the device\n\n## How Activation Lock affects you\nWhile Activation Lock helps secure iOS devices and improves the chances of recovering a lost or stolen device, this capability can present you, as an IT admin, with a number of challenges. For example:\n\n-   A user sets up Activation Lock on a device. The user then leaves the company and returns the device. Without the user's Apple ID and password, there is no way to reactivate the device.\n\n-   You need a report of all devices that have Activation Lock enabled.\n\n-   You want to reassign some devices to a different department during a device refresh in your organization. You can only reassign devices that do not have Activation Lock enabled.\n\nTo help solve these problems, Apple introduced Activation Lock bypass in iOS 7.1. This lets you remove the Activation Lock from supervised devices without the user's Apple ID and password. Supervised devices can generate a device-specific Activation Lock bypass code, which is stored on Apple's activation server.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Supervised mode for iOS devices lets you use Apple Configurator to lock down a device and limit functionality to specific business purposes. Supervised mode is generally only for corporate-owned devices.\n\n## How Intune helps you manage Activation Lock\nIntune can request the Activation Lock status of both supervised and unsupervised devices that run iOS 8.0 and later. For supervised devices only, Intune can retrieve the Activation Lock bypass code and directly issue it to the device. If the device has been wiped, you can directly access the device by using the code as the user name and a blank password.\n\n**The business benefits of this are**:\n\n-   The user gets the security benefits of the Find My iPhone app.\n\n-   You can enable users to do their work and know that when a device needs to be repurposed, you can retire or unlock it.\n\n## How to use Activation Lock bypass from the Intune admin console\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> After you bypass the Activation Lock on a device, a new Activation Lock is automatically applied if the Find My iPhone app is opened. Because of this, **you should be in physical possession of the device before you follow this procedure**.\n\n1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), choose **Groups** &gt; **All Devices** &gt; **All Corporate-owned Devices**.\n\n2.  Select the device whose Activation Lock you want to bypass. Choose **Activation Lock Bypass**.\n\n3.  Read the warning message. Choose **Yes** to proceed.\n\nYou can examine the status of the unlock request on the details page for the device.\n\n## How to see which devices are using Activation Lock\nYou can see which devices are using Activation Lock in two ways:\n\n-   Run the **Mobile Device Inventory Reports**. This report displays the **Activation Lock Status** and **Supervised** columns to indicate the state of devices. The values for **Supervised** are **Yes** or **No**, and the values for **Activation Lock Status** are:\n\n    -   Enabled with bypass code\n\n    -   Enabled without bypass code (device is not supervised)\n\n    -   Enabled without bypass code (device cannot be reached)\n\n    -   Not enabled\n\n    The **Activation Lock Status** box is blank for devices that do not run iOS 8.0 or later.\n\n-   Select a device in a groups view to see the Activation Lock status in the device details pane.\n\n    If you select a device in the **All Corporate-owned Devices** node and Activation Lock is enabled for the device, you can also see the bypass code. This code can be used to manually issue an Activation Lock bypass.\n\n    > [!IMPORTANT]\n    >Intune takes inventory from devices for Activation Lock every seven days. Because of this, devices might not immediately be displayed with their Activation Lock status in the Intune console.\n\n\n### See also\n[Retire devices](retire-devices-from-microsoft-intune-management.md)\n[Help protect your devices with remote lock and passcode reset](use-remote-lock-and-passcode-reset-in-microsoft-intune.md)\n"}
