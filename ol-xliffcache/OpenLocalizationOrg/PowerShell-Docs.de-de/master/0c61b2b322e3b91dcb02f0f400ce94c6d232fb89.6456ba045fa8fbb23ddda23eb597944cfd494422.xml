Install the ATA Gateway\n\nBefore installing the ATA Gateway on a dedicated server, validate that port mirroring is properly configured and that the ATA Gateway can see traffic to and from the domain controllers. See [Validate port mirroring](validate-port-mirroring.md) for more information.\n\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Make sure that [KB2919355](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2919355/) has been installed.

Extract the files from the zip file. \n> [!NOTE] \n> Installing directly from the zip file will fail.\n\n2.  Run **Microsoft ATA Gateway Setup.exe** and follow the setup wizard.\n\n3.  On the **Welcome** page, select your language and click **Next**.\n\n4.  The installation wizard will automatically check if the server is a domain controller or a dedicated server. If it is a domain controller, the ATA Lightweight Gateway will be installed, if it is a dedicated server, the ATA Gateway will be installed. \n    \n    For example, in the case of an ATA Lightweight Gateway, the following screen will be displayed to let you know that an ATA Lightweight Gateway will be installed on your domain controller:\n    \n    ![ATA Lightweight Gateway installation](media/ATA-lightweight-gateway-install-selected.png)\n    Click **Next**.\n\n    > [!NOTE] \n    > If the domain controller or dedicated server does not meet the minimum hardware requirements for the installation, you will receive a warning.
