Intune client in a number of ways. One way in which it does this is to provide policies that enable you to configure Windows Firewall settings on PCs.\n\nIf you have not yet installed the Intune Windows PC client on your computers, see [Install the Windows PC client with Microsoft Intune](install-the-windows-pc-client-with-microsoft-intune.md).\n\nUse the information in the following sections to help you configure, deploy, and monitor Windows Firewall policies on Windows PCs.\n\n## Use Intune policies to manage Windows Firewall\nThe Windows Firewall policy lets you create and deploy settings that control Windows Firewall on managed PCs. You cannot manage custom exceptions for Windows Firewall, and these settings do not affect third-party firewalls.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If Microsoft Intune policy and Group Policy are configured to manage the same setting on the PC, the Group Policy setting overrides the Microsoft Intune policy. For information about how to avoid conflicts between Intune policy and Group Policy, see [Resolve GPO and Microsoft Intune policy conflicts](resolve-gpo-and-microsoft-intune-policy-conflicts.md).\n>\n> If you want to deploy Windows Firewall settings to computers that run Windows Vista, you must first install [Hotfix KB971800](http://support2.microsoft.com/kb/971800) on these computers.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> To manage Windows Firewall by using Intune, ensure that the following two services are enabled on the computers that you manage:\n>\n> -   Windows Firewall\n> -   IPsec Policy Agent\n\n## Configure a Windows Firewall policy\n\n1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com/), choose **Policy** &gt; **Add Policy**.\n\n2.  Configure and deploy a **Windows Firewall Settings** policy. You can use the recommended settings or customize the settings. If you need more information about how to create and deploy policies, see [Common Windows PC management tasks with the Microsoft Intune computer client](common-windows-pc-management-tasks-with-the-microsoft-intune-computer-client.md).\n\n    The following section lists the values that you can configure in the policy and also the default values that will be used if you donâ€™t customize the policy.\n\nAfter you deploy a Windows Firewall policy, you can view its status on the **All Policies** page of the **Policy** workspace.\n\n## Specify policy settings for Windows Firewall\n\n### Turn on Windows Firewall\n\nThese policy settings enable Windows Firewall on managed computers that are:\n- Connected to a domain (for example, at the workplace)\n- Connected to a private (trusted) network (such as a home network)\n- Connected to an untrusted public network (such as a coffee shop)\n\nThe default value for each of these settings is **Yes**, which is the most secure value.\n\n\n\n### Block all incoming connections, including those in the list of allowed programs\n\nThese policy settings configure Windows Firewall to block incoming network traffic on managed computers that are:\n- Connected to a domain (for example, at the workplace)\n- Connected to a private (trusted) network (such as a home network)\n- Connected to an untrusted public network (such as a coffee shop)\n\nThe default value for each of these settings is **Yes**, which is the most secure value.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> If your environment includes managed computers that are running Windows Vista with no service packs installed, you must either install the update that's associated with [article 971800](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=188405) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base or disable the **Block all incoming connections** policy settings in policies that are deployed to those computers.\n\n### Notify the user when Windows Firewall blocks a new program\n\nThese policy settings determine whether Windows Firewall notifies a PC user when it blocks incoming network traffic when the managed computer is:\n- Connected to a domain (for example, at the workplace)\n- Connected to a private (trusted) network (such as a home network)\n- Connected to an untrusted public network (such as a coffee shop)\n\nThe default value for each of these settings is **Yes**.\n\n\n### Configure predefined exceptions\n\nYou can configure exceptions that allow specific types of network traffic through the firewall regardless of the values that you configured earlier. None of these settings are configured by default.\n\n|Setting name|Details|\n|------------------|--------------------|\n|**BranchCache - Content Retrieval**<br>(Windows 7 or later)|Lets BranchCache clients use HTTP to retrieve content from other BranchCache clients while in distributed mode and from the hosted cache while in hosted cache mode.
