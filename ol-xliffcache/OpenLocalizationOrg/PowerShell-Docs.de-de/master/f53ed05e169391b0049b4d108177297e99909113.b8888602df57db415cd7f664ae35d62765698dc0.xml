This account will be configured as the ATA Honeytoken user. If someone attempts to use this user account ATA will create a suspicious activity and is an indication of malicious activity. To configure the Honeytoken user you will need the SID of the user account, not the user name.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n> You can find the SID of the user on the *Account Info* tab of the user's profile in the ATA console.\n\n\n![ATA detection settings honeytoken](media/ata-detection-settings-honeytoken-1.7.png)\n\n\n**Detection Exclusions** - You can exclude IP addresses from the following detections.
