management (MAM) policies by using either the Intune App Wrapping Tool or the Intune App SDK. Use this information to learn about these two methods and when to use them.\n\n## Intune App Wrapping Tool\nThe App Wrapping Tool is used primarily for internal line-of-business (LOB) apps. The tool is a command line application that creates a wrapper around the app, which then allows the app to be managed by an Intune mobile application management policy. You don't need the source code to use the tool, but you do need signing credentials.  For more about signing credentials, see the [Intune blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2015/02/25/how-to-obtain-the-prerequisites-for-the-intune-app-wrapping-tool-for-ios/). For the App Wrapping Tool documentation, see [Android App Wrapping Tool ](prepare-android-apps-for-mobile-application-management-with-the-microsoft-intune-app-wrapping-tool.md) and [iOS App Wrapping Tool](prepare-ios-apps-for-mobile-application-management-with-the-microsoft-intune-app-wrapping-tool.md).\n\nThe App Wrapping Tool does not support Apps in the App or Play Store or features that require development time integration (see the following feature comparison table).\n\nYou should use the App Wrapping Tool, rather than the SDK, if the  app has already been written or if the source code isn't available.\n\n**The App Wrapping Tool for MAM on devices that are not enrolled in Intune is currently supported in public preview. For more information, see [Protect LOB apps on devices not enrolled in Intune](protect-line-of-business-apps-and-data-on-devices-not-enrolled-in-microsoft-intune.md) topic**.\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\n|**App Wrapping Tool** | **Xamarin** |**Cordova** |\n|------|----|----|\n|**iOS** |Yes|Yes|\n|**Android**| No |Yes|\n## Intune App SDK\nThe App SDK is designed mainly for customers who have apps in the App or Play stores and want to be able to manage the apps with Intune. However, any app can take advantage of integrating the SDK, even if it’s a LOB app.\n\nTo learn more about the SDK, see the [Overview](/intune/develop/intune-app-sdk).
