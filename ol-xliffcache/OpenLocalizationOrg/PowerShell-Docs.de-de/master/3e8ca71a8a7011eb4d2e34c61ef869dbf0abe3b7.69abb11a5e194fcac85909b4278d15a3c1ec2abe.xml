mobile device management with Microsoft Intune\nFor Microsoft Intune to directly manage mobile devices, devices must be [enrolled in Intune](get-ready-to-enroll-devices-in-microsoft-intune.md). As an alternative, administrators can enable a more limited management solution that uses Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) management with an Exchange connector. Devices can be managed with either on-premises Exchange servers and Exchange Online using Office 365. Intune only supports one Exchange connector connection of any type per subscription.\n\n## Exchange access rules for mobile devices ##\n\nExchange needs a set of rules that defines what happens when mobile devices attempt to connect to EAS. These rules are managed in the Intune administration console.\n\n[Exchange access rules for mobile devices](exchange-access-rules-for-mobile-devices.md)\n\n## Install the Exchange connector\nThe Exchange connector lets you manage your Exchange deployment in the Intune console. You must first install and configure the appropriate Intune-to-Exchange connector.
