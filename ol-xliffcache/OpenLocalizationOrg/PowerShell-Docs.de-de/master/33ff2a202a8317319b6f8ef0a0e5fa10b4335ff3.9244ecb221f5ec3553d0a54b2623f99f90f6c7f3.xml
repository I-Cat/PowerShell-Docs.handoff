When you deploy and manage apps with Intune, the process for uninstalling the app is the same for both mobile devices and Windows PCs. The app must support the uninstallation process for this procedure to succeed.\n\n## Uninstall an app\n\n1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), choose **Apps** &gt; **Apps**.\n\n2.  Select the app you want to uninstall (one that has been previously deployed), and then choose **Manage Deployment**.\n\n3.  On the **Deployment Action** page, select **Uninstall** from the **Approval** column.\n\nWhen the device or computer next checks for apps, the app will be uninstalled.\n\n### See also\n[Add apps in Microsoft Intune](add-apps.md)\n"}
