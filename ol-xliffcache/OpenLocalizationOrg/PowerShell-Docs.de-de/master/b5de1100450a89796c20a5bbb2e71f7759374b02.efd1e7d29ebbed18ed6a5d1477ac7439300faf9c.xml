resource with PowerShell classes\nms.date:  2016-05-16\nkeywords:  powershell,DSC\ndescription:  \nms.topic:  article\nauthor:  eslesar\nmanager:  dongill\nms.prod:  powershell\n---\n\n# Writing a custom DSC resource with PowerShell classes\n\n> Applies To: Windows Windows PowerShell 5.0\n\nWith the introduction of PowerShell classes in Windows PowerShell 5.0, you can now define a DSC resource by creating a class. The class defines both the schema and the implementation of the resource, so there is no need to create a separate MOF file. The folder structure for a class-based resource is also simpler, because a **DSCResources** folder is not necessary.\n\nIn a class-based DSC resource, the schema is defined as properties of the class which can be modified with attributes to specify the property type.. The resource is implemented by **Get()**, **Set()**, and **Test()** methods (equivalent to the **Get-TargetResource**, **Set-TargetResource**, and **Test-TargetResource** functions in a script resource.\n\nIn this topic, we will create a simple resource named **FileResource** that manages a file in a specified path.\n\nFor more information about DSC resources, see [Build Custom Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration Resources](authoringResource.md)\n\n## Folder structure for a class resource\n\nTo implement a DSC custom resource with a PowerShell class, create the following folder structure. The class is defined in **MyDscResource.psm1** and the module manifest is defined in **MyDscResource.psd1**.\n\n```\n$env:ProgramFiles\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules (folder)\n    |- MyDscResource (folder)\n        |- MyDscResource.psm1 \n           MyDscResource.psd1 \n```\n\n## Create the class\n\nYou use the class keyword to create a PowerShell class. To specify that a class is a DSC resource, use the **DscResource()** attribute. The name of the class is the name of the DSC resource.\n\n```powershell\n[DscResource()]\nclass FileResource {\n}\n```\n\n### Declare properties\n\nThe DSC resource schema is defined as properties of the class. We declare three properties as follows.\n\n```powershell\n[DscProperty(Key)]\n[string]$Path\n\n[DscProperty(Mandatory)]\n[Ensure] $Ensure\n\n[DscProperty(Mandatory)]\n[string] $SourcePath\n\n[DscProperty(NotConfigurable)]\n[Nullable[datetime]] $CreationTime\n```\n\nNotice that the properties are modified by attributes. The meaning of the attributes is as follows:\n\n- **DscProperty(Key)**: The property is required. The property is a key. The values of all properties marked as keys must combine to uniquely identify a resource instance within a configuration.\n- **DscProperty(Mandatory)**: The property is required.\n- **DscProperty(NotConfigurable)**: The property is read-only. Properties marked with this attribute cannot be set by a configuration, but are populated by the **Get()** method when present.\n- **DscProperty()**: The property is configurable, but it is not required.\n\nThe **$Path** and **$SourcePath** properties are both strings. The **$CreationTime** is a [DateTime](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.datetime.aspx) property. The **$Ensure** property is an enumeration type, defined as follows.\n\n```powershell\nenum Ensure \n{ \n    Absent \n    Present \n}\n```\n\n### Implementing the methods\n\nThe **Get()**, **Set()**, and **Test()** methods are analogous to the **Get-TargetResource**, **Set-TargetResource**, and **Test-TargetResource** functions in a script resource.\n\nThis code also includes the CopyFile() function, a helper function that copies the file from **$SourcePath** to **$Path**. \n\n```powershell\n\n    <#\n        This method is equivalent of the Set-TargetResource script function.\n        It sets the resource to the desired state.\n    #>\n    [void] Set()\n    {\n        $fileExists = $this.TestFilePath($this.Path)\n\n        if ($this.ensure -eq [Ensure]::Present)\n        {\n            if(-not $fileExists)\n            {\n                $this.CopyFile()\n            }\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            if ($fileExists)\n            {\n                Write-Verbose -Message \"Deleting the file $($this.Path)\"\n                Remove-Item -LiteralPath $this.Path -Force\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    <#\n        This method is equivalent of the Test-TargetResource script function.\n        It should return True or False, showing whether the resource\n        is in a desired state.\n    #>\n    [bool] Test()\n    {\n        $present = $this.TestFilePath($this.Path)\n\n        if ($this.Ensure -eq [Ensure]::Present)\n        {\n            return $present\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            return -not $present\n        }\n    }\n\n    <#\n        This method is equivalent of the Get-TargetResource script function.\n        The implementation should use the keys to find appropriate resources.\n        This method returns an instance of this class with the updated key\n         properties.\n    #>\n    [FileResource] Get()\n    {\n        $present = $this.TestFilePath($this.Path)\n\n        if ($present)\n        {\n            $file = Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath $this.Path\n            $this.CreationTime = $file.CreationTime\n            $this.Ensure = [Ensure]::Present\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            $this.CreationTime = $null\n            $this.Ensure = [Ensure]::Absent\n        }\n\n        return $this\n    }\n\n    <#\n        Helper method to check if the file exists and it is file\n    #>\n    [bool] TestFilePath([string] $location)\n    {\n        $present = $true\n\n        $item = Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath $location -ErrorAction Ignore\n\n        if ($item -eq $null)\n        {\n            $present = $false\n        }\n        elseif ($item.PSProvider.Name -ne \"FileSystem\")\n        {\n            throw \"Path $($location) is not a file path.\"\n        }\n        elseif ($item.PSIsContainer)\n        {\n            throw \"Path $($location) is a directory path.\"\n        }\n\n        return $present\n    }\n\n    <#\n        Helper method to copy file from source to path\n    #>\n    [void] CopyFile()\n    {\n        if (-not $this.TestFilePath($this.SourcePath))\n        {\n            throw \"SourcePath $($this.SourcePath) is not found.\"\n        }\n\n        [System.IO.FileInfo] $destFileInfo = New-Object -TypeName System.IO.FileInfo($this.Path)\n\n        if (-not $destFileInfo.Directory.Exists)\n        {\n            Write-Verbose -Message \"Creating directory $($destFileInfo.Directory.FullName)\"\n\n            <#\n                Use CreateDirectory instead of New-Item to avoid code\n                to handle the non-terminating error\n            #>\n            [System.IO.Directory]::CreateDirectory($destFileInfo.Directory.FullName)\n        }\n\n        if (Test-Path -LiteralPath $this.Path -PathType Container)\n        {\n            throw \"Path $($this.Path) is a directory path\"\n        }\n\n        Write-Verbose -Message \"Copying $($this.SourcePath) to $($this.Path)\"\n\n        # DSC engine catches and reports any error that occurs\n        Copy-Item -LiteralPath $this.SourcePath -Destination $this.Path -Force\n    }\n```\n\n### The complete file\nThe complete class file follows.\n\n```powershell\nenum Ensure\n{\n    Absent\n    Present\n}\n\n<#\n   This resource manages the file in a specific path.\n   [DscResource()] indicates the class is a DSC resource\n#>\n\n[DscResource()]\nclass FileResource\n{\n    <#\n       This property is the fully qualified path to the file that is\n       expected to be present or absent.\n\n       The [DscProperty(Key)] attribute indicates the property is a\n       key and its value uniquely identifies a resource instance.\n       Defining this attribute also means the property is required\n       and DSC will ensure a value is set before calling the resource.\n\n       A DSC resource must define at least one key property.\n    #>\n    [DscProperty(Key)]\n    [string]$Path\n\n    <#\n        This property indicates if the settings should be present or absent\n        on the system.

Our manifest looks like this:\n\n```powershell\n@{\n\n# Script module or binary module file associated with this manifest.\nRootModule = 'MyDscResource.psm1'\n\nDscResourcesToExport = 'FileResource'\n\n# Version number of this module.\nModuleVersion = '1.0'\n\n# ID used to uniquely identify this module\nGUID = '81624038-5e71-40f8-8905-b1a87afe22d7'\n\n# Author of this module\nAuthor = 'Microsoft Corporation'\n\n# Company or vendor of this module\nCompanyName = 'Microsoft Corporation'\n\n# Copyright statement for this module\nCopyright = '(c) 2014 Microsoft. All rights reserved.'\n\n# Description of the functionality provided by this module\n# Description = ''\n\n# Minimum version of the Windows PowerShell engine required by this module\nPowerShellVersion = '5.0'\n\n# Name of the Windows PowerShell host required by this module\n# PowerShellHostName = ''\n} \n```\n\n## Test the resource\n\nAfter saving the class and manifest files in the folder structure as described earlier, you can create a configuration that uses the new resource. For information about how to run a DSC configuration, see [Enacting configurations](enactingConfigurations.md). The following configuration will check to see whether the file at `c:\\test\\test.txt` exists, and, if not, copies the file from `c:\\test.txt` (you should create `c:\\test.txt` before you run the configuration).\n\n```powershell\nConfiguration Test\n{\n    Import-DSCResource -module MyDscResource\n    FileResource file\n    {\n        Path = \"C:\\test\\test.txt\"\n        SourcePath = \"c:\\test.txt\"\n        Ensure = \"Present\"\n    } \n}\nTest\nStart-DscConfiguration -Wait -Force Test\n```\n\n## See Also\n### Concepts\n[Build Custom Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration Resources](authoringResource.md)\n\n"}
