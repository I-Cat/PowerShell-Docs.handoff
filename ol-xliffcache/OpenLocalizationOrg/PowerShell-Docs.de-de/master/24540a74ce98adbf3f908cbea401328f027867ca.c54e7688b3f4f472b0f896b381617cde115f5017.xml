Additionally, you can use the Apple Configurator tool to create custom settings that are not available from Intune.\n\n## General configuration policy settings\n\nUse the Microsoft Intune **iOS general configuration policy** to configure settings for:\n\n-   **General device, and security settings**. Choose from a list of predefined settings that let you control a range of features and functionality on the device.\n\n-   **Kiosk mode**. Lock a device to allow only certain features to work. For example, you can allow a device to run only one managed app that you specify, or you can disable the volume buttons on a device. These settings might be used for a demonstration model of a device, or a device that is dedicated to performing only one function, such as a point-of-sale device.\n\n-   **Compliant and noncompliant apps**. Specify a list of apps that are compliant or not compliant in your company. On Android and iOS devices, the **Noncompliant Apps Report** can be used to view the compliance of apps that you specified in the list against the apps that users have installed (but cannot actually block the installation of the app).\n\n> [!TIP]\n> You can configure terms and conditions for users to ensure that they acknowledge that apps on their device (including personal apps) will be evaluated, and noncompliant apps will be either blocked or reported as noncompliant. Users must accept these terms and conditions before they can enroll their device and use the company portal to get apps. For more information about using terms and conditions, see [Terms and conditions policy settings in Microsoft Intune](terms-and-condition-policy-settings-in-microsoft-intune.md).\n\nIf the setting you are looking for does not appear in this topic, you might be able to create it by using an iOS custom policy that lets you import settings you created by using the [Apple Configurator tool](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator/id434433123?mt=12). For more information, see \"Custom policy settings\" later in this topic.\n\n### Security settings\nAll settings apply to iOS 8.0 and later.\n\n|Setting name|Details|\n|----------------|-------|\n|**Require a password to unlock mobile devices**|Specify whether the user is required to enter a password to access their device.|\n|**Required password type**|Specify the type of password that will be required, such as numeric only or alphanumeric.|\n|**Number of complex characters required in password**|Specify the number of symbol characters (like **#** or **@**) that must be included in the password.|\n|**Minimum password length**|Specify the minimum number of characters in the password.|\n|**Allow simple passwords**|Allow simple passwords like **0000** and **1234**.|\n|**Number of repeated sign-in failures to allow before the device is wiped**|Specify the number of failed login attempts before this setting wipes the device.|\n|**Minutes of inactivity before password is required**<sup>1</sup>|Specify how long the device can remain idle before the user must re-enter their password.|\n|**Password expiration (days)**|Specify the number of days before the device password must be changed.|\n|**Remember password history**|Specify whether the user can use passwords that they have previously used.|\n|**Remember password history** – **Prevent reuse of previous passwords**|Specify the number of previously used passwords that the device remembers.|\n|**Minutes of inactivity before screen turns off**<sup>1</sup>|Specify the number of minutes before the device display is turned off.|\n|**Allow fingerprint unlock**|Allow using a fingerprint to unlock the device.|\n<sup>1</sup> For iOS devices, when you configure the settings **Minutes of inactivity before screen turns off** and **Minutes of inactivity before password is required**, they are applied in sequence. For example, if you set the value for both settings to **5** minutes, the screen will turn off automatically after 5 minutes, and the device will be locked after an additional 5 minutes. However, if the user turns off the screen manually, the second setting is immediately applied. In the same example, after the user turns off the screen, the device will lock 5 minutes later.\n\n### System settings\nAll settings apply to iOS 8.0 and later.\n\n|Setting name|Details|\n|----------------|-------|\n|**Allow screenshot**|Allow the user to capture the contents of the screen as an image.|\n|**Allow control center in lock screen**|Allow the user to access the control center app when the device is locked.|\n|**Allow notification view in lock screen**|Allow the user to access the notifications view without unlocking the device.|\n|**Allow today view in lock screen**|Allow the user to view notifications when the device is locked.|\n|**Allow untrusted TLS certificates**|Allow untrusted Transport Layer Security certificates on the device.|\n|**Allow diagnostic data submission**|Allow or block the device from submitting diagnostic data to Apple.|\n|**Allow passbook while locked**|Allow the user to access the Passbook app while the device is locked.|\n\n### Cloud settings for documents and data\nAll settings apply to iOS 8.0 and later.\n\n|Setting name|Details|\n|----------------|-------|\n|**Allow backup to iCloud**|Allow the user to back up the device to iCloud.|\n|**Allow document sync to iCloud**|Allow document and key-value synchronization to your iCloud storage space.|\n|**Allow Photo Stream sync to iCloud**|Allow photos on the device to sync to iCloud.|\n|**Require encrypted backup**|Require any device backups to be encrypted.|\n|**Allow managed apps to sync data to iCloud**|Allow apps that you manage with Intune to sync data to the user's iCloud account.|\n|**Allow Handoff to continue activities on another device**|Allow the user to continue work that they started on an iOS device on another iOS or Mac OS X device.|\n|**Allow iCloud Photo Sharing**|Allow use of the iOS shared photo stream feature.|\n|**Allow iCloud Photo Library**|Allow the user to store photos on iCloud.

This tool lets you create many settings that control the operation of these devices and export them to a configuration profile. You can then import this configuration profile into an Intune iOS custom policy and deploy the settings to users and devices in your organization.\n\nThis capability allows you to deploy iOS settings that are not configurable with Intune general configuration policies.\n\n### Prerequisites\nBefore you start, you must have installed the Apple Configurator and created a configuration file that contains the settings that you want to deploy to users or devices. You can download and learn about the Apple Configurator from [the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator/id434433123?mt=12).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Intune does not report the compliance of individual settings in an iOS custom policy. However, the overall compliance of the policy is reported.\n\n### General settings\n\n|Setting name|Details|\n    |----------------|--------------------|\n    |**Name**|Enter a unique name for the iOS custom policy to help you identify it in the Intune console.|\n    |**Description**|Provide a description that gives an overview of the iOS custom policy and other relevant information that helps you to locate it.|\n\n### Custom settings\n\n|Setting name|Details|\n    |----------------|--------------------|\n|**Custom configuration profile name (displayed to users)**|Provide a name for the policy as it will be displayed on the device, and in Intune policy reports.|\n|**Configuration profile file**|Choose **Import**, and then browse to the configuration profile that you created by using the Apple Configurator. **Note:** Ensure that the settings you export from the Apple Configurator tool are compatible with the version of iOS on the devices to which you deploy the iOS custom policy. For information about how incompatible settings are resolved, search for **Configuration Profile Reference** and **Mobile Device Management Protocol Reference** on the [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/) website.|\n    |**Configuration profile details**|Display the XML code for the configuration profile that you imported.|\n\n### See also\n[Manage settings and features on your devices with Microsoft Intune policies](manage-settings-and-features-on-your-devices-with-microsoft-intune-policies.md)\n"}
