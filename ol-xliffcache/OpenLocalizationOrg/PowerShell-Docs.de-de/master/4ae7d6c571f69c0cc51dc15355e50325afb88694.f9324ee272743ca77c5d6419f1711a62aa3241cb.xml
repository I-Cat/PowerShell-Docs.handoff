You should have already configured the Intune Connector in the Lookout MTP console before doing this step.  If you have not already done so, do the steps described in  [Set up your subscription with Lookout mobile threat protection](set-up-your-subscription-with-lookout-mtp.md).\n\nTo enable the Lookout MTP connection in Intune, on the **Administration** page in the [Microsoft Intune administrator console](https://manage.microsoft.com), choose **Third Party Service Integration**. Choose **Lookout status** and enable **Synchronization with MTP** using the toggle button.\n\n![screenshot of the Lookout synchronization page with the enable toggle button highlighted](../media/mtp/lookout-intune-synchronization.png)\n\nThis completes the setup of the Lookout and Intune integration in the Intune administrator console.  The next few steps to implement this solution involve deploying the [Lookout for Work apps](configure-and-deploy-lookout-for-work-apps.md) and setting up the [compliance](enable-device-threat-protection-rule-in-compliance-policy.md) policy.\n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\n> You **must** configure the Lookout for Work app before creating compliance policy rules and configuring conditional access.
