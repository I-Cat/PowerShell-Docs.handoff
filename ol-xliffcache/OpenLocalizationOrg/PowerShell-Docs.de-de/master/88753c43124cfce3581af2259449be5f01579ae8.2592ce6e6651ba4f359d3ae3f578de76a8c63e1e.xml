If we want to sort by **State** and then by **Name**, we can do it by typing:\n\n```\nGet-WmiObject -Class Win32_SystemDriver | Sort-Object -Property State,Name | Format-Table -Property Name,State,Started,DisplayName -AutoSize -Wrap\n```\n\nAlthough this is a lengthy display, you can see items with the same state grouped together:\n\n```\nName           State   Started DisplayName\n----           -----   ------- -----------\nACPI           Running    True Microsoft ACPI Driver\nAFD            Running    True AFD\nAmdK7          Running    True AMD K7 Processor Driver\nAsyncMac       Running    True RAS Asynchronous Media Driver\n...\nAbiosdsk       Stopped   False Abiosdsk\nACPIEC         Stopped   False ACPIEC\naec            Stopped   False Microsoft Kernel Acoustic Echo Canceller\n...\n```\n\nYou can also sort the objects in reverse order by specifying the **Descending** parameter. This reverses the sort order so that names are sorted in reverse alphabetical order and numbers are sorted by descending size.\n\n```\nPS> Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_SystemDriver | Sort-Object -Property State,Name -Descending | Format-Table -Property Name,State,Started,DisplayName -AutoSize -Wrap\n\nName           State   Started DisplayName\n----           -----   ------- -----------\nWS2IFSL        Stopped   False Windows Socket 2.0 Non-IFS Service Provider Supp\n                               ort Environment\nwceusbsh       Stopped   False Windows CE USB Serial Host Driver...\n...\nwdmaud         Running    True Microsoft WINMM WDM Audio Compatibility Driver\nWanarp         Running    True Remote Access IP ARP Driver\n...\n```\n\n"}
