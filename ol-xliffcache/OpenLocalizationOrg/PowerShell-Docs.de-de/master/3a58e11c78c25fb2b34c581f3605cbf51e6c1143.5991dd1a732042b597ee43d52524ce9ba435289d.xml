devices in Microsoft Intune\nTo let employees enroll mobile devices (including [Android](set-up-android-management-with-microsoft-intune.md), [iOS and Mac](set-up-ios-and-mac-management-with-microsoft-intune.md), [Windows Phone](set-up-windows-phone-management-with-microsoft-intune.md), and [Windows PCs](set-up-windows-device-management-with-microsoft-intune.md)) with Intune or to manage company-owned devices you must enable device enrollment. To allow enrollment, you must set a mobile device management (MDM) authority, configure the Intune Company Portal, assign licenses, and enable enrollment for the device platform.\n\n## Set mobile device management authority\nThe MDM authority defines the management service that has permission to manage a set of devices. The options for the MDM authority include Intune by itself and Configuration Manager with Intune. If you set Configuration Manager as the management authority, no other service can be used for mobile device management.\n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\n> Consider carefully whether you want to manage mobile devices by using Intune only (online service) or System Center Configuration Manager with Intune (on-premises software solution in conjunction with the online service). After you set the mobile device management authority, this cannot be changed.\n\n\n\n1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](http://manage.microsoft.com), choose **Admin** &gt; **Mobile Device Management**.\n\n2.  In the **Tasks** list, click **Set Mobile Device Management Authority**. The **Set MDM Authority** dialog box opens.\n\n    ![Set MDM authority dialog box](../media/intune-mdm-authority.png)\n\n3.  Intune requests confirmation that you want Intune as your MDM authority. Select the check box, and then choose **Yes** to use Microsoft Intune to manage mobile devices.\n\n## Configure the Intune Company Portal\n\nThe Intune Company Portal is where users access company data and can do common tasks like enrolling devices, installing apps, and locating information for assistance from your IT department.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> When you customize the Company Portal, the configurations apply to both the Company Portal website and Company Portal apps.\n\nCustomizing the Company Portal helps to provide a familiar and helpful experience for your end users. To do this, just sign in to the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com) as a tenant or service administrator, choose **Admin** &gt; **Company Portal**, and configure the Company Portal settings.\n\n![admin-console-admin-workspace-comp-portal-settings](../media/cp_sa_cpsetup.PNG)\n\n### Company contact information and privacy statement\n\nThe company name is displayed as the Company Portal title.

These links cannot be changed. When a user signs in, these links display your subscriptions in the Company Portal.\n\n## Assign an Intune user license\n\nYou use the **Office 365 management portal** to manually add cloud-based users and assign licenses to both cloud-based user accounts and accounts that are synchronized from your on-premises Active Directory to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).\n\n1.  Sign in to the [Office 365 management portal](https://portal.office.com/Admin/Default.aspx) by using your tenant administrator credentials.\n\n2.  Select the user account that you want to assign an Intune user license to, and then select the **Microsoft Intune** check box on the user account properties.\n\n3.  The user account will now be added to the Microsoft Intune user group, which grants the user permissions to use the service and enroll their devices into management.\n\n## Set up device management\nAfter setting up the MDM authority, you need to set up device management for the operating systems that your organization wants to support. The steps that are required to set up device management vary by operating system. For example, the Android OS does not require you to do anything in the Intune administration console. On the other hand, Windows and iOS require a trust relationship between devices and Intune to allow management.\n\n> [!div class=\"op_single_selector\"]\n- [Set up Android management with Microsoft Intune](set-up-android-management-with-microsoft-intune.md)\n- [Set up iOS and Mac management with Microsoft Intune](set-up-ios-and-mac-management-with-microsoft-intune.md)\n- [Set up Windows Phone management with Microsoft Intune](set-up-windows-phone-management-with-microsoft-intune.md)\n- [Set up Windows device management with Microsoft Intune](set-up-windows-device-management-with-microsoft-intune.md)\n\nYou can also:\n - Use the [device enrollment manager account](enroll-corporate-owned-devices-with-the-device-enrollment-manager-in-microsoft-intune.md) to enroll many devices.\n - [Specify company-owned devices by using IMEI numbers](specify-corporate-owned-devices-with-international-mobile-equipment-identity-imei-numbers.md) to help enroll devices and target policy.\n"}
