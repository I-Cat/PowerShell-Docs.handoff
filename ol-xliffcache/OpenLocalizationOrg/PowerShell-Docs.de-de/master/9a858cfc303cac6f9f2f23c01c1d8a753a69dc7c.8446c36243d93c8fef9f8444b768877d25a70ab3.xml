ID is the name you use in the console. Title is what is shown at the top of the item page in search results.]\n\n## Examples\n\n    ID:\"PSReadline\"\n    id:\"AzureRM.Profile\"\n\nfinds items with \"PSReadline\" or \"AzureRM.Profile\" in their ID field respectively.\n\n    Id:\"AzureRM.Profile\"\n\nis another way to find items with \"AzureRM.Profile\" in their ID field.\n\nThe 'Id' filter is a substring match, so if you search for the following:\n\n    Id:\"azure\"\n    \nYou'll get results like 'AzureRM.Profile' and 'Azure.Storage'.\n\nYou can also search for multiple keywords in a single field. Or mix and match fields.\n\n    id:azure tags:intellisense\n    id:azure id:storage\n\nAnd you can perform phrase searches:\n\n    id:\"azure.storage\"\n\n\nTo search all items with DSC tag.\n\n    Tags:\"DSC\"\n\nTo search all items with the specified function.\n\n    Functions:\"Update-AzureRM\"\n\nTo search all items with the specified cmdlet.\n    \n    Cmdlets:\"Get-AzureRmEnvironment\"\n\nTo search all items with the specified DSC Resource name.\n\n    DscResources:\"xArchive\"\n\nTo search all items with the specified PowerShellVersion\n\n    PowerShellVersion:\"5.0\"\n    PowerShellVersion:\"3.0\"\n    PowerShellVersion:\"2.0\"\n\n\nFinally, if you use a field we don't support, such as 'commands', we'll just ignore it and search all the fields.
