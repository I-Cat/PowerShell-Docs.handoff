Additionally, you can specify Open Mobile Alliance Uniform Resource Identifier (OMA-URI) values to create custom settings that are not available from Intune.\n\n## General configuration settings\n\nUse the Microsoft Intune **Windows Phone general configuration policy (Windows Phone 8.1 and later)** to configure the following settings for Windows Phone 8.1 devices:\n\n-   **Mobile device security settings** – Choose from a list of predefined settings that let you control a range of features and functionality on the device.\n\n-   **Compliant and noncompliant apps** - Specify a list of apps that are compliant or not compliant in your company. Windows Phone devices can block or allow installation of these apps.\n\n### Applicability settings\n\n|Setting name|Details|\n|----------------|----------------------------------|\n|**Apply all configurations to Windows 10**|Enables settings in this policy to be applied to Windows 10 Mobile devices in addition to Windows Phone 8.1 devices.|\n\n### Password settings\n\n|Setting name|Details|Windows Phone 8|Windows Phone 8.1|\n|----------------|------|-----|------------------------------|\n|**Require a password to unlock mobile devices**|Specifies whether users must enter a password to access their devices.|Yes|Yes|\n|**Required password type**|Specifies the type of password that will be required, such as alphanumeric or numeric only.|Yes|Yes|\n|**Required password type – Minimum number of character sets**|Specifies how many different character sets must be included in the password.

You cannot specify both in the same policy.\n\n|Setting name|Details|\n|----------------|--------------------|\n|**Block devices from opening the listed apps**|Lists the apps that are not managed by Intune, and which users are not allowed to install and run.|\n|**Allow devices to install only the listed apps**|Lists the apps that users are allowed to install. Users cannot install any other apps. Apps that are managed by Intune are automatically allowed.|\n|**Add**|Adds an app to the selected list. Specify a name of your choice, the URL to the app in the app store, and the app publisher (optional). For more help, see How to specify URLs to app stores later in this topic.\n|**Import Apps**|Imports a list of apps that you have specified in a comma-separated values file. Use the format, application name, publisher, and app URL in the file.|\n|**Edit**|Lets you edit the name, publisher, and URL of the selected app.|\n|**Delete**|Deletes the selected app from the list.|\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> If you specify a list of allowed apps for Windows Phone 8.1 devices, you must add the Company Portal app to this list or it will be blocked.\n\n\n### Reference information for allowed and blocked apps\n\n#### How to specify URLs to app stores\nTo specify an app URL in the allowed and blocked apps list, use the following format:\n\nFrom the [Windows Phone Apps+Games](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/overview) page, search for the app that you want to use.\n\nOpen the app’s page, and copy the URL to the clipboard. You can now use this as the URL in either the allowed or blocked apps list.\n\n**Example:** Search the store for the Skype app. The URL you use will be **http://www.windowsphone.com/store/app/skype/c3f8e570-68b3-4d6a-bdbb-c0a3f4360a51**.\n\n## Custom policy settings\nUse the Microsoft Intune **Windows Phone custom configuration policy** to deploy OMA-URI settings that can be used to control features on **Windows Phone 8.1 devices**. These are standard settings that many mobile device manufacturers use to control device features.\n\nThis capability enables you to deploy Windows Phone settings that are not configurable with an Intune general configuration policy. For information about the settings you can configure with these policies, see [Manage settings and features on your devices with Microsoft Intune policies](manage-settings-and-features-on-your-devices-with-microsoft-intune-policies.md).\n\nFor help creating OMA-URI settings for Windows Phone devices, see [Windows Phone 8.1 MDM protocol documentation](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn499787.aspx).\n\n### General settings\n\n|Setting name|Details|\n|----------------|--------------------|\n|**Name**|Enter a unique name for the policy to help you identify it in the Intune console.|\n|**Description**|Provide a description that gives an overview of the policy and other relevant information that helps you to locate it.|\n\n### OMA-URI settings\n\nIn the **OMA-URI Settings** section, click **Add** to add a setting. You can also edit or delete an existing setting.\n\nIn the **Add or Edit OMA-URI Setting** dialog box, specify the following information:\n\n|Setting name|Details|\n    |--------|--------------------|\n    |**Setting name**|Enter a unique name for the OMA-URI setting to help you identify it in the list of settings.|\n    |**Setting description**|Provide a description that gives an overview of the setting and other relevant information to help you locate it.|\n    |**Data type**|Select the data type in which you will specify this OMA-URI setting.
