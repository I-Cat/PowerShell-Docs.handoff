This process factory-resets the device and prepares it to run the Setup Assistant by the device’s new user with the company's policies preinstalled.\n\n\n## Setup Assistant enrollment for iOS devices with Microsoft Intune\nUsing Apple Configurator you can factory reset iOS devices and prepares them for setup by the device’s new user.  This method requires you to USB-connect the iOS device to a Mac computer to setup corporate enrollment and assumes you are using Apple Configurator 2.0. Most scenarios require that the policy applied to the iOS device include **user affinity** to enable the Intune Company Portal app.\n\n**Prerequisites**\n* [iOS enrollment enabled](set-up-ios-and-mac-management-with-microsoft-intune.md) by installing an APNs certificate\n* Physical access to iOS devices - Devices must be unconfigured (factory reset) without password protection\n* Device serial numbers - [How to get an iOS serial number](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204308)\n* USB connection cables\n* Mac computer with [Apple Configurator 2.0](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator-2/id1037126344?mt=12)\n\n\n1.  **Create mobile device group** (Optional)\n    If your business requires mobile device groups to help manage devices, create those groups. [Use groups to manage users and devices with Microsoft Intune](use-groups-to-manage-users-and-devices-with-microsoft-intune.md).\n\n2.  **Create a profile for devices**\n    A device enrollment profile defines the settings applied to a group of devices. If you have not already, create a device enrollment profile for iOS devices enrolled using Apple Configurator.\n\n    1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](http://manage.microsoft.com) go **Policy** &gt; **Corporate Device Enrollment**, and then choose **Add…**.\n    ![Create device enrollment profile](../media/pol-sa-corp-enroll.png)\n\n    2.  Enter details for the device profiles:\n\n        -   **Name** – Name of the device enrollment profile. (Not visible to users)\n\n        -   **Description** - Description of the device enrollment profile. (Not visible to users)\n\n        -   **Enrollment Details** – Specifies how devices are enrolled.\n\n            -   **Prompt for user affinity** – The device must be affiliated with a user during initial setup and could then be permitted to access company data and email as that user. **User affinity** should be configured for DEP-managed devices that belong to users and need to use the company portal (i.e. to install apps).\n\n            -   **No user affinity** – The device is not affiliated with a user. Use this affiliation for devices that perform tasks without accessing local user data. Apps requiring user affiliation, including the Company Portal app used for installing line-of-business apps, won’t work.\n\n        -   **Device group pre-assignment** – All devices deployed this profile will initially belong to this group. You can reassign devices after enrollment.\n\n            [!INCLUDE[groups deprecated](../includes/group-deprecation.md)]\n\n          -  **Device Enrollment Program** - The Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP) cannot be used with Setup Assistant enrollment. Ensure the toggle is set to **off**.\n\n    3.  Choose **Save Profile** to add the profile.\n\n3.  **Add iOS devices to enroll with Setup Assistant**\n    In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](http://manage.microsoft.com) go **Groups** &gt; **All Devices** &gt; **All Corporate-owned Devices** &gt; **All Devices**, and then choose **Add devices…**. You can add devices in two ways:\n\n    ![Add devices dialog box](../media/pol-SA-enroll-iOS-SetupAssistant.png)\n\n    -   **Upload a CSV file containing serial numbers** – Create a comma-separated value (.csv) list of two columns without a header, limited to 5000 devices or 5MB per csv file.\n\n        |||\n        |-|-|\n        |&lt;Serial #1&gt;|&lt;Device #1 Details&gt;|\n        |&lt;Serial#2&gt;|&lt;Device #2 Details&gt;|\n        This .csv file when viewed in a text editor appears as:\n\n        ```\n        0000000,PO 1234\n        111111111,PO 1234\n        ```\n\n    -   **Manually add device details** - Enter the serial number and device details of up to five devices\n\n    > [!NOTE]\n    > If you must later remove corporate-owned devices from Intune management, you might need to remove the device serial number from Intune in the **By iOS Serial Number** device group under **Corporate Pre-enrolled devices** to disable device enrollment.  If Intune performs a disaster recovery procedure on or around the time that serial numbers were removed, you will need to verify that only active devices’ serial numbers are present in that group.\n\n    Choose **Next**.\n\n4.  **Select devices to enroll**\n    Confirm the devices to enroll. Serial numbers already enrolled or enrolled by other means cannot be imported. Choose **Next** to continue.\n\n5.  **Assign profile**\n    Specify the profile to assign to added devices from the list of available profiles, review the **Enrollment profile details**, and then choose **Finish**. Manually added devices can be assigned to any Enrollment profile.\n\n6.  **Export a profile to deploy to iOS devices**\n    In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](http://manage.microsoft.com) go **Policy** &gt; **Corporate Device Enrollment**, and then select the device profile to deploy to mobile devices. Choose **Export…** in the taskbar. Copy and save the **Profile URL**. You will upload it in Apple Configurator later to define the Intune profile used by iOS devices.\n    To support Apple Configurator 2, the 2.0 Profile URL must be edited. Replace\n    ```\n    https://manage.microsoft.com/EnrollmentServer/Discovery.svc/iOS/ESProxy?id=\n    ```\n    with\n\n    ```\n    https://appleconfigurator2.manage.microsoft.com/MDMServiceConfig?id=\n    ```\n\n   You will upload this profile URL to the Apple DEP service using Apple Configurator in the following procedure to define the Intune profile used by iOS devices.\n\n\n\n7.  **Prepare the device with Apple Configurator**\n    iOS devices are connected to the Mac computer and enrolled for mobile device management.\n\n    1.  On a Mac computer, open **Apple Configurator 2**. In the menu bar, choose **Apple Configurator 2**, and then choose **Preferences**.\n\n         > [!WARNING]\n         > The devices will be reset to factory configurations during the enrollment process. As a best practice, reset the device and power it on. As a best practice, devices should be at the **Hello** screen when you connect the device.\n\n    2. In the preferences pane, select **Servers** and choose the “+” symbol below the left pane to launch the MDM Server wizard. Choose **Next**.\n\n    3. Enter the **Name** and **Enrollment URL** for the MDM server from Step #6 above. For the Enrollment URL enter the enrollment profile URL exported from Intune. Choose **Next**.  \n\n       If you receive a warning stating \"server URL is not verified,\"\" you can safely disregard the warning. To continue, choose **Next** until the wizard is complete.\n\n    4.  Connect the iOS mobile devices to the Apple computer with a USB adapter.\n\n        > [!WARNING]\n        > The devices will be reset to factory configurations during the enrollment process. As a best practice, reset the device and power it on. As a best practice, devices should be at the **Hello** screen when you start Setup Assistant.\n\n    5.  Choose **Prepare**. On the **Prepare iOS Device** pane, select **Manual** and then choose **Next**.\n\n    6. On the **Enroll in MDM Server** pane, select the server name you created and then choose **Next**.\n\n    7. On the **Supervise Devices** pane, select the level of supervision, and then choose **Next**.\n\n    8. On the **Create an Organization** pane, choose the **Organization** or create a new organization,  and then choose **Next**.\n\n    9. On the **Configure iOS Setup Assistant** pane, choose the steps presented to the user, and then choose **Prepare**. If prompted, authenticate to update trust settings.  \n\n    10. When the iOS device finishes preparing, you can disconnect the USB cable.  \n\n8.  **Distribute devices**\n    The devices are now ready for corporate enrollment. Power down the devices and distribute them to users. When the device is turned on, the Setup Assistant will start.\n\n\n\n### See also\n[Get ready to enroll devices](get-ready-to-enroll-devices-in-microsoft-intune.md)\n"}
