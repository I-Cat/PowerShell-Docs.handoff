Set this property to \"Stopped\" to ensure that the service is not running. Set it to \"Running\" to ensure that the service is not running.| \n| DependsOn | Indicates that the configuration of another resource must run before this resource is configured. For example, if the **ID** of the resource configuration script block that you want to run first is **ResourceName** and its type is **ResourceType**, the syntax for using this property is `DependsOn = \"[ResourceType]ResourceName\"`.| \n\n\n## Additional Information\n\nThe **nxService** resource will not create a service definition or script for the service if it does not exist. You can use the PowerShell Desired State Configuration **nxFile** Resource resource to manage the existence or contents of the service definition file or script.\n\n## Example\n\nThe following example shows configuration of the “httpd” service (for Apache HTTP Server), registered with the **SystemD** service controller.\n\n```\nImport-DSCResource -Module nx \n\nNode $node {\n#Apache Service\nnxService ApacheService \n{\nName = \"httpd\"\nState = \"running\"\nEnabled = $true\nController = \"systemd\"\n}\n}\n```\n\n"}
