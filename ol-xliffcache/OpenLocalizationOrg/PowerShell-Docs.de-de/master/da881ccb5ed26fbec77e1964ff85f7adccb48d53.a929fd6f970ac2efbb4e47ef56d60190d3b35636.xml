what's happening in Microsoft Intune.\n\nFor example, alerts can notify you about the following events:\n\n-   A problem with the Exchange Connector which affects mobile device management\n\n-   Malware was found on a computer\n\n-   A conflict between two Intune policies was detected\n\n\n## How alerts work\nAlerts are generated based on **alert types**, a set of preconfigured rules built into Intune. For example, the alert type, **Cloud storage has 10% or less free space**, alerts you when you are running out of space to store your apps in the cloud. You can enable or disable alert types and configure properties for each alert type. For example, using the above alert type, you can configure:\n\n-   **State:** Whether this alert type is enabled or disabled\n\n-   **Severity:** How serious is this alert?\n\n\n|Severity|Details|\n|--------|-------|\n    |![Critical alert](../media/Critical-Alert.jpg)|Indicates a serious issue that you should investigate as soon as possible, for example, if malware was detected on a computer.|\n    |![Warning alert](../media/Warning-Alert.jpg)|Indicates an issue that isn't currently serious but might become serious if you don't attend to it, for example, security updates are waiting to be installed.|\n    |![Informational alert](../media/Informational-Alert.jpg)|Indicates information that isn't critical to your operations, for example, a new version of the Exchange Connector is available.|\n\nOther alert types might have different items that you can configure, like the percentage of devices that must be affected by an issue before an alert is generated.\n\n**When the criteria in an alert type is met, an alert is generated and shown in the Intune admin console.**\n\nAdditionally, you can configure Intune to notify you by email when an alert is generated.\n\n## Set up alerts\nIn the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), choose **Admin** &gt; **Alerts and Notifications**, and then choose one of the following tasks:\n\n|Task|Description|\n|--------|---------------|\n|**Alert Types**|Choose the alert type that you want to configure, and then do one of the following:<br /><br />Choose **Configure**.
