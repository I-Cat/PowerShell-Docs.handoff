running on devices that may or may not be managed by Intune. For a more detailed description of how MAM policies work and the scenarios supported by Intune MAM policies, read the [protect app data using mobile app management policies](protect-app-data-using-mobile-app-management-policies-with-microsoft-intune.md) topic.\n\nThis topic describes the process of creating a MAM policy in the **Azure portal**. The Azure portal is the new admin console for creating MAM policies, and we recommend that you use this portal to create MAM  policies. Azure portal supports the following MAM scenarios:\n- Devices enrolled in Intune\n- Devices managed by a third-party MDM solution\n- Devices that are not managed by any MDM solution (BYOD).\n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\nConsider the following if you are currently using the **Intune admin console** to manage your devices:\n\n> * You can create a MAM policy that supports apps for devices enrolled in Intune using the [Intune admin console](configure-and-deploy-mobile-application-management-policies-in-the-microsoft-intune-console.md).\n> * MAM policies created in the Intune admin console cannot be imported into the Azure portal.  The MAM policies must be recreated in the Azure portal.\n\n> * You may not see all MAM policy settings in the Intune admin console. The Azure portal is the new admin console for creating MAM policies.\n\n> * To deploy manage apps, you must create a MAM policy in the Intune admin console. In this case, you may want to create MAM policies in both the Intune admin console and the Azure portal: Intune admin console to make sure you have the ability to deploy managed apps, Azure portal because it is the new admin console that has all the MAM policy settings.\n\n> * If you create MAM policies on both Intune admin console and Azure portal, the policy that is created in the Azure portal is applied to the apps.\n\nTo see a list of policy settings supported for Android and iOS platforms, select one of the following:\n\n> [!div class=\"op_single_selector\"]\n- [iOS policies](ios-mam-policy-settings.md)\n- [Android policies](android-mam-policy-settings.md)\n\n##  Create a MAM policy\nBefore creating a MAM policy, review the [pre-requisites and support](get-ready-to-configure-mobile-app-management-policies-with-microsoft-intune.md) information.\n1.

You can create more than one policy for each platform.\n\n    ![Screenshot of the Add a policy blade](../media/AppManagement/AzurePortal_MAM_AddPolicy_only.png)\n\n4.  Choose **Apps** to open the **Apps blade** where a list of available apps is displayed. You can select one or more apps from the list that you want to associate with the policy that you are creating. One you have selected the apps, choose the **Select** button at the bottom of the **Apps** blade to save your selection.\n\n    > [!IMPORTANT]\n    > You must select at least one app to create a policy.\n\n5.  On the **Add a policy blade**, choose **Configure required settings** to open the policy settings blade.\n\n    There are two categories of policy settings,**Data relocation** and **Access**.  Data relocation policies are applicable to data movement in and out of the apps, while the access polices determine how the end user accesses the apps in a work context.\n    To get you started the policy settings have default values.  You do not have to make any changes if the default values meet your requirements.\n\n    > [!TIP]\n    > These policy settings are enforced only when using apps in the work context.  When the end user uses the app to do a personal task, they will not be affected by these policies.\n\n    ![Screenshot of the settings blade along with the Add a policy blade](../media/AppManagement/AzurePortal_MAM_PolicySettings.png)\n\n6.  Choose **OK** to save this configuration.  You are now back in the **Add a policy** blade. Choose **Create** to create the policy and save your settings.\n\n    ![Screenshot of the Add a policy blade showing that the Apps and Settings have been configured](../media/AppManagement/AzurePortal_MAM_CreatePolicy.png)\n\n\n\nWhen you finish creating a policy as described in the previous procedure, it is not deployed to any users.  Follow the steps described below to deploy the policy.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> If you create a MAM policy for an app using the Intune admin console and a MAM policy using the Azure portal, the policy you created using the Azure portal takes precedence. However, the reporting in the Intune or Configuration Manager console will report the policy settings created from the Azure  portal. For example:\n>\n> -   You created a mobile application management policy in the Intune admin console that blocks copy from an app.\n> -   You created a mobile app management policy in the Azure console that allows copy from an app\n> -   You associate both of these policies to the same app.\n> -   The result is that the policy you created from the Azure console takes precedence and copy is allowed.\n> -   However, status and reports in the Intune console will incorrectly indicate that copy is blocked.\n\n## Deploy a policy to users\n\n1.  In the **Policy** blade, choose  **User groups**, which opens the **User groups** blade. Choose **Add user group** in the **User groups** blade to open the **Add user group** blade.\n\n    ![Screenshot of the User groups blade with the Add user group menu option highlighted](../media/AppManagement/AzurePortal_MAM_AddUserstoPolicy.png)\n\n2.  A list of user groups is displayed on the **Add user group** blade. This is a list of all the security groups in your **Azure Active Directory**.  You can select the user groups you want this policy to apply to and choose **Select**. Choosing **Select**, deploys the policy to users.\n\n    ![Screenshot of the Add user group blade showing the list of Azure Active Directory users](../media/AppManagement/AzurePortal_MAM_SelectUserstoDeploy.png)\n\n    You have now created a policy and deployed it to users.\n\nOnly users with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] licenses assigned to them will be affected by the policy.  Users who are in the security group that you selected that don’t have a [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] license assigned to them are not affected.\n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\n> If you are using Intune with Configuration Manager to manage your iOS and Android devices, the policy is only applied to the users directly in the group that you selected.  Members of child groups  nested within the group you selected will not be affected.\n\nThe end users can download the apps from the App store or Google Play.

However, when you change existing policies,  users who are already signed  in to the apps won’t see the changes for an 8-hour period.\n\nTo see the effect of the changes immediately the end user will have to log out of the app, and sign back in.\n\n### To change the list of apps associated with the policy\n\n1.  In  the **App policy** blade, choose the policy you want to change. This opens a blade specific to the policy you just selected.\n\n    ![Screenshot of an existing policy opened in a separate blade](../media/AppManagement/AzurePortal_MAM_OpenPolicy.png)\n\n2.  In the policy blade, choose **Targeted apps** to open the list of apps.\n\n3.  Remove or add apps from the list and choose the **Save icon** to save your changes.\n\n### To change the list of user groups\n\n1.  In  the **App policy** blade, choose the policy you want to change. This opens the blade specific to the policy you selected.\n\n2.  In the policy blade, choose **User groups** to open the **User group** blade that shows the list of current user groups who have this policy.\n\n3.  To **add a new user group** to the policy, choose **Add user group**, and select the user group. Choose **Select** to deploy the policy to the group you selected.\n\n    ![Screenshot of the Add user group blade with two users selected](../media/AppManagement/AzurePortal_MAM_ChangePolicy_SelectUser.png)\n\n4.  To **delete a user group**, highlight the user group you want to remove, choose the ellipses (…), then choose **Delete** to remove the user group.\n\n    ![Screenshot showing a Delete option ](../media/AppManagement/AzurePortal_MAM_ChangePolicy_DeleteUser.png)\n\n### To change policy settings\n\n1.
