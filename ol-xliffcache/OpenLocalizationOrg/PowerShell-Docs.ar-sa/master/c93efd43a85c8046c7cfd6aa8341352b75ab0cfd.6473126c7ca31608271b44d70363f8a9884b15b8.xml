lifecycle\n\nThe Intune app lifecycle begins when an app is added and progresses through additional phases until you remove the app.\n\n![The app lifecycle](./media/app-lifecycle.png \"the Intune app lifecycle\")\n\n## Add\n\nThe first step in app deployment is to add the apps, which you want to manage and deploy, to Intune. While you can work with many different app types, the basic procedures are the same. With Intune, you can add apps for both [enrolled devices](add-apps-for-mobile-devices-in-microsoft-intune.md) and [Windows PCs you manage with the Intune client software](add-apps-for-windows-pcs-in-microsoft-intune.md).\n\n## Deploy\n\nAfter you've added the app to Intune, you can then [deploy it to devices that you manage](deploy-apps.md). Intune makes this process easy, and after the app is deployed, you can [monitor the success](monitor-apps-in-microsoft-intune.md) of the deployment from the Intune administration console. Additionally, in some app stores, like the  [Apple](manage-ios-apps-you-purchased-through-a-volume-purchase-program-with-microsoft-intune.md) and [Windows](manage-apps-you-purchased-from-the-windows-store-for-business-with-microsoft-intune.md) app stores, you can purchase app licenses in bulk for your company. Intune can synchronize data with these stores so that you can deploy and track license usage for these types of apps right from the Intune administration console.\n\n## Configure\n\nAs part of the app lifecycle, new versions of apps are regularly released. Intune provides tools to easily [update apps](update-apps-using-microsoft-intune.md) that you have deployed to a newer version. Additionally, you can configure extra functionality for some apps, for example:\n- [iOS app configuration policies](configure-ios-apps-with-mobile-app-configuration-policies-in-microsoft-intune.md) supply settings for compatible iOS apps that are used when the app is run. For example, an app might require specific branding settings or the name of a server to connect to.\n- [Managed browser policies](manage-internet-access-using-managed-browser-policies.md) help you to configure settings for the Intune managed browser, which replaces the default device browser and lets you restrict the websites that your users can visit.\n\n## Protect\n\nIntune gives you many ways to help protect the data in your apps. The main methods are:\n- [Conditional access](restrict-access-to-email-and-o365-services-with-microsoft-intune.md) controls access to email and other services based on conditions that you specify. Conditions include device types or compliance with a [device compliance policy](introduction-to-device-compliance-policies-in-microsoft-intune.md) that you deployed.\n- [Mobile application management (MAM)](protect-app-data-using-mobile-app-management-policies-with-microsoft-intune.md) works with individual apps to help protect the company data that they use. For example, you can restrict copying data between unmanaged apps and apps that you manage, or you can prevent apps from running on devices that have been jailbroken or rooted.\n\n## Retire\n\nEventually, it's likely that apps that you deployed become outdated and need to be removed. Intune makes it easy to [retire apps from service](retire-apps-using-microsoft-intune.md).\n"}
