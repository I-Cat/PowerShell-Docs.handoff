Once enrolled in Intune, devices with imported IMEI numbers can be viewed under **Groups** > **Overview** > **All Devices**. **Device group** lists display devices with imported IMEI numbers as **Corporate** in the **Ownership** column.\n\n1. In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](http://manage.microsoft.com) choose **Groups** &gt; **All Devices** &gt; **All Corporate Pre-enrolled Devices** &gt; **By IMEI (All platforms)**, and then choose **Add devices…**. You can add devices in two ways:\n\n    -   **Upload a CSV file containing serial numbers** – Create a comma-separated value (.csv) list of two columns without a header, limited to 5000 devices or 5MB per csv file.\n\n        |||\n        |-|-|\n        |&lt;IMEI #1&gt;|&lt;Device #1 Details&gt;|\n        |&lt;IMEI #2&gt;|&lt;Device #2 Details&gt;|\n        This .csv file when viewed in a text editor appears as:\n\n        ```\n        AABBBBBBCCCCCCD,PO 1234\n        AABBBBBBCCCCCCE,PO 1234\n        ```\n\n    -   **Manually add device details** - Enter the IMEI number and device details of up to five devices\n\n   *Details* are for administrative use so you can identify which IMEI number is associated with a device. This information is not sent to the device but will appear in the Intune console.\n\n2.   Choose **Next**.\n3.  On the **Review Devices** pane you can confirm which device IMEI numbers are imported. You can also decide whether to overwrite the **Details** for IMEI numbers being re-imported. You can uncheck the **Overwrite** checkbox to preserve the Current details. Choose **Finish** to import the IMEI numbers.\n4.  The added IMEI numbers and descriptions are added to the **By IMEI (All platforms)** list.\n\nWhen the device with that IMEI number enrolls, usually when a user installs the Company Portal app and completes the enrollment process, the device will be tagged as Corporate owned and appear as enrolled in the **IMEI Devices** group.\n"}
