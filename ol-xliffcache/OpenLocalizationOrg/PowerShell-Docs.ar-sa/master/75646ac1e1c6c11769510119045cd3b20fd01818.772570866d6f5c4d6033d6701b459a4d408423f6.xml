The components in ATA process data sequentially, so that when there's a problem, it might cause partial dropped traffic somewhere along the chain of components. In order to fix the problem, you have to figure out which component is backfiring and fix the problem at the beginning of the chain. Use the data found in the performance counters to understand how each component is functioning.\n    Refer to [ATA architecture](/advanced-threat-analytics/plan-design/ata-architecture) to understand the flow of internal ATA components.\n\n**ATA component process**:\n\n1.  When a component reaches its maximum size, it blocks the previous component from sending more entities to it.\n\n2.  Then, eventually the previous component will start to increase **its** own size until it blocks the component before it, from sending more entities.\n\n3.  This happens all the way back to the NetworkListener component which will drop traffic when it can no longer forward entities.\n\n\n## ATA Gateway performance counters\n\nIn this section, every reference to ATA Gateway refers also to the ATA Lightweight Gateway.\n\nYou can observe the real time performance status of the ATA Gateway by adding the ATA Gateway's performance counters.\nThis is done by opening \"Performance Monitor\" and adding all counters for the ATA Gateway. The name of the performance counter object is: \"Microsoft ATA Gateway\".\n\nHere is the list of the main ATA Gateway counters to pay attention to:\n\n|Counter|Description|Threshold|Troubleshooting|\n|-----------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|\n|Microsoft ATA Gateway\\NetworkListener PEF Parser Messages/Sec|The amount of traffic being processed by the ATA Gateway every second.|No threshold|Helps you understand the amount of traffic that is being parsed by the ATA Gateway.|\n|NetworkListener PEF Dropped Events/Sec|The amount of traffic being dropped by the ATA Gateway every second.|This number should be zero all of the time (rare short burst of drops are acceptable).|Check if there is any component that reached its maximum size and is blocking previous components all the way to the NetworkListener.
