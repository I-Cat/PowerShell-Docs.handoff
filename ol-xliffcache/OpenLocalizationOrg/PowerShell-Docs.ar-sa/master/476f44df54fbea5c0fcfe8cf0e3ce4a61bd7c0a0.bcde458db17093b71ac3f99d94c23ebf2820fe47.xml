policy?\nTo protect company data, you need to make sure that the devices used to access company apps and data, comply with certain rules like using a PIN to access the device, and encryption of data stored on the device. A set of such rules is referred to as a compliance policy.\n\n## How should I use compliance policies?\nYou can use compliance policies with conditional access policies to only allow devices that comply with compliance policy rules to access email, and other services. Read the [restrict access to email and O365 services](restrict-access-to-email-and-o365-services-with-microsoft-intune.md) article to understand how the two policies can be used together.\n\nYou can also use compliance policies independently of conditional access. When used independently, the targeted devices are evaluated and reported with their compliance status. For example, you might want to report about how many devices are not encrypted, or which devices are jailbroken or rooted. However, when used independently, no access restrictions to company resources are in place.\n\nYou deploy compliance policies to users. When a compliance policy is deployed to a user, the user's devices are checked for compliance.\n\nThe following table lists the device types supported by compliance policies and how noncompliant settings are managed when the policy is used with a conditional access policy.\n\n-----------------------------\n\n|Policy Setting| Windows 8.1 and later| Windows Phone 8.1 and later| iOS 8.0 and later|Android 4.0 and later<br/>Samsung KNOX Standard 4.0 and later|\n|-----|----|----|----|----|\n|**PIN or Password Configuration** |Remediated|Remediated|Remediated|Quarantined|\n|**Device encryption**|N/A|Remediated|Remediated (by setting PIN)|Quarantined|\n|**Jailbroken or rooted device**|N/A|N/A|Quarantined (not a setting)|Quarantined (not a setting)|\n|**Email profile**|N/A|N/A|Quarantined|N/A|\n|**Minimum OS version**|Quarantined|Quarantined|Quarantined|Quarantined|\n|**Maximum OS version**|Quarantined| Quarantined| Quarantined| Quarantined|\n|**Windows health attestation**|Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile are Quarantined.<br /><br />Setting is not applicable to Windows 8.1|N/A|N/A|N/A|\n\n------------------------------\n\n**Remediated** = Compliance is enforced by the device operating system (for example, the user is forced to set a PIN).  There is never a case when the setting is noncompliant.\n\n**Quarantined** = The device operating system does not enforce compliance (for example, Android devices do not force the user to encrypt the device). When the devices is not compliant, the following actions take place:\n\n-   The device will be blocked if the user is targeted by a conditional access policy.\n\n-   The company portal will notify the user about any compliance issues.\n\n## Next steps\n[Create a device compliance policy](create-a-device-compliance-policy-in-microsoft-intune.md)\n\n[Deploy and monitor a device compliance policy](deploy-and-monitor-a-device-compliance-policy-in-microsoft-intune.md)\n\n### See also\n[Restrict access to email and O365 services](restrict-access-to-email-and-o365-services-with-microsoft-intune.md)\n"}
