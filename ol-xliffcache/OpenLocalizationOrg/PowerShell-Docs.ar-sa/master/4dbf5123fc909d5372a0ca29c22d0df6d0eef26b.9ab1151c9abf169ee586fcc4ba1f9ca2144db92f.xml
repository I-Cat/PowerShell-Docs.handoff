management in Intune\nYou can enroll devices, including Windows PCs, to enable mobile device management (MDM) with Microsoft Intune. This topic describes different ways to enroll mobile devices in Intune management. How devices enroll devices depends on the device type, ownership, and the level of management needed. \"Bring your own device\" (BYOD) enrollment lets users enroll their personal phones, tablets, or PCs. Corporate-owned device (COD) enrollment enables management scenarios like remote wipe, shared devices, or user affinity for a device.\n\nIf you use [Exchange ActiveSync](#mobile-device-management-with-exchange-activesync-and-intune), either on-premises or hosted in the cloud, you can enable simple Intune management without enrollment. Windows PCs can also be managed using [Intune client software](#manage-windows-pcs-with-intune).\n\n## Overview of device enrollment methods\n\nThe following table shows Intune's enrollment methods with their supported capabilities. These capabilities include:\n- **Wipe** - Factory reset the device, removing all data. [Retire devices](retire-devices-from-microsoft-intune-management.md)\n- **Affinity** - Associates devices with users. Required for mobile application management (MAM) and conditional access to company data. [User Affinity](enroll-corporate-owned-ios-devices-in-microsoft-intune.md#using-company-portal-on-dep-or-apple-configurator-enrolled-devices)\n- **Lock** Prevents users from  removing the device from management. iOS devices require Supervised mode for Lock.

This can let users connect to the company network, joining the domain or Azure Active Directory. Enabling BYOD enrollment is a prerequisite for many COD scenarios for most platforms. See [Prerequisites for device enrollment](prerequisites-for-enrollment.md). ([Back to the table](#overview-of-device-enrollment-methods))\n\n## Corporate-owned devices\nCorporate-owned devices (COD) can be managed with the Intune console. iOS devices can be enrolled directly through tools provided by Apple. All device types can be enrolled by an admin or manager using the device enrollment manager. Devices with an IMEI number can also be identified and tagged as company-owned to enable COD scenarios.\n\n[Enroll corporate-owned devices](manage-corporate-owned-devices.md)\n\n### DEM\nDevice enrollment manager is a special Intune account used to enroll and manage multiple corporate-owned devices. Managers can install the Company Portal and enroll many user-less devices. Learn more about [DEM](enroll-corporate-owned-devices-with-the-device-enrollment-manager-in-microsoft-intune.md). ([Back to the table](#overview-of-device-enrollment-methods))\n\n### DEP\nApple Device Enrollment Program (DEP) management lets you create and deploy policy “over the air” to iOS devices purchased and managed with DEP. The device is enrolled when the user turns on the device for the first time and runs the iOS Setup Assistant. This method supports **iOS Supervised** mode which in turn enables:\n  - Locked enrollment\n  - Conditional access\n  - Jailbreak detection\n  - Mobile application management\n\nLearn more about [DEP](ios-device-enrollment-program-in-microsoft-intune.md). ([Back to the table](#overview-of-device-enrollment-methods))\n\n### USB-SA\nUSB-connected, Setup Assistant enrollment. The admin creates an Intune policy and exports it to Apple Configurator. USB-connected, corporate-owned devices are prepared with Intune policy. The admin must enroll each device by hand. Users receive their devices and run Setup Assistant, enrolling their device. This method supports **iOS Supervised** mode which in turn enables:\n  - Conditional access\n  - Jailbreak detection\n  - Mobile application management\n\nLearn more about [Setup Assistant enrollment with Apple Configurator](ios-setup-assistant-enrollment-in-microsoft-intune.md). ([Back to the table](#overview-of-device-enrollment-methods))\n\n### USB-Direct\nDirect enrollment. The admin creates an Intune policy and exports it to Apple Configurator. USB-connected, corporate-owned devices are enrolled directly without requiring a factory reset. The admin must enroll each device by hand. Devices are managed as user-less devices. They are not locked or supervised and cannot support conditional access, jailbreak detection, mobile application management. Learn more about [direct enrollment with Apple Configurator](ios-direct-enrollment-in-microsoft-intune.md). ([Back to the table](#overview-of-device-enrollment-methods))\n\n## Mobile device management with Exchange ActiveSync and Intune\nMobile devices that aren't enrolled but that connect to Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) can be managed by Intune using EAS MDM policy. Intune uses an Exchange Connector to communicate with EAS, either on-premises and cloud-hosted.\n\n[Mobile device management with Exchange ActiveSync and Intune](mobile-device-management-with-exchange-activesync-and-microsoft-intune.md)\n\n\n## Manage Windows PCs with Intune  \nYou can also use Microsoft Intune to manage Windows PCs using the Intune client software. PCs managed with the Intune client can:\n\n - Report software and hardware inventories\n - Install desktop applications (for example .exe and .msi files)\n - Firewall settings\n\nPCs managed with the Intune client software cannot be wiped, and cannot take advantage of many Intune management features such as conditional access, VPN and Wi-Fi settings, or deployment of certificates and email configurations.\n\n[Manage Windows PCs with Intune](manage-windows-pcs-with-microsoft-intune.md)\n\n##  Supported device platforms\n\nIntune can manage the following device platforms:\n\n[!INCLUDE[mdm-supported-devices](../includes/mdm-supported-devices.md)]\n\n## Next steps\n- [Prerequisites for device enrollment](prerequisites-for-enrollment.md)\n- [Manage corporate-owned devices](manage-corporate-owned-devices.md)\n- [Supported mobile  devices and computers](../get-started/supported-mobile-devices-and-computers.md)\n"}
