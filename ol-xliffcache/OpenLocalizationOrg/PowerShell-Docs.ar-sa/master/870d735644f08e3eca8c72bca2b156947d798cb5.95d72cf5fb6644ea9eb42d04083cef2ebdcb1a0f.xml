devices. Additionally, you can specify Open Mobile Alliance Uniform Resource Identifier (OMA-URI) values to create custom settings that are not available from Intune.\n\n## General configuration policy\n\nUse the Intune **Android general configuration policy** to configure settings for:\n\n-   **Mobile device security settings** - Choose from a list of predefined settings that let you control a range of features and functionality on the device.\n\n-   **Kiosk mode** (for Samsung KNOX devices only) - Lock a device to allow only certain features to work. For example, you can allow a device to run only one managed app that you specify, or you can disable the volume buttons on a device. These settings might be used for a demonstration model of a device or a device that is dedicated to performing only one function, such as a point-of-sale device.\n\n-   **Compliant and noncompliant apps** - Specify a list of apps that are compliant or noncompliant in your company. On Android and iOS devices, the **Noncompliant Apps Report** can be used to view the compliance of apps that you specified in the list against the apps that users have installed. The report can't actually block the installation of the app.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> You can configure terms and conditions for users to ensure that they acknowledge that all apps on their device, including personal apps, will be evaluated, and that noncompliant apps will either be blocked or reported as noncompliant. Users must accept these terms and conditions before they can enroll their device and use the company portal to get apps. For more information about using terms and conditions, see [Terms and condition policy settings in Microsoft Intune](terms-and-condition-policy-settings-in-microsoft-intune.md).\n\nIf the setting you are looking for does not appear in this topic, you might be able to create it by using an Android custom policy that lets you use OMA-URI settings to control the device. For more information, go to [Custom policy settings](#custom-policy-settings) later in this topic.\n\n### Password settings\n\n|Setting name|Details|Android 4.0+|Samsung KNOX|\n|----------------|-|----------------|----------------|\n|**Require a password to unlock mobile devices**|Specifies whether to require a password on supported devices.|Yes|Yes|\n|**Minimum password length**|Specifies the minimum length of the password.|Yes|Yes|\n|**Number of repeated sign-in failures to allow before the device is wiped**|Specifies the number of sign-in failures to allow before the device is wiped.|Yes|Yes|\n|**Minutes of inactivity before screen turns off**|Specifies the number of minutes of inactivity before the device automatically locks.|Yes|Yes|\n|**Password expiration (days)**|Specifies the number of days before a password must be changed.|Yes|Yes|\n|**Remember password history**|Specifies the number of previously used passwords to remember.|Yes|Yes|\n|**Remember password history** - **Prevent reuse of previous passwords**|Prevents reuse of previous passwords.|Yes|Yes|\n|**Password quality**|Specifies the password complexity level that's required and whether biometric devices can be used.|Yes|Yes|\n|**Allow fingerprint unlock**|Allows the use of a fingerprint to unlock the device.|No|Yes|\n|**Allow Smart Lock and other trust agents**<br>(Android 5 and later)|Lets you control the Smart Lock feature on compatible Android devices.
